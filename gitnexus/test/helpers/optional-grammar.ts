 * Grammars that ship as an npm `optionalDependency` or a vendored prebuild are
 * absent on platforms without a build for them, so the suites that need them
 * skip by contract. That contract has a hole: a language whose grammar never
 * installs *anywhere in CI* merges with every one of its suites reported
 * green-by-skip, and its native parser path is never executed once.
 *
 * `GITNEXUS_REQUIRE_<LANG>=1` closes it. A job that sets it declares "this
 * platform has a prebuild, so the grammar MUST be here" and a missing grammar
 * becomes a hard failure instead of a skip — the same contract
 * `GITNEXUS_REQUIRE_FTS` gives the FTS suites (test/helpers/fts-availability.ts).
 * Local and prebuild-less runs leave the variable unset and keep skipping.
 *
 * Add a language here only once at least one *required* CI job runs on a
 * platform its grammar publishes a prebuild for; otherwise the gate would fail
 * a job it cannot satisfy.
