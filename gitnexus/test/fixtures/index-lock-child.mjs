/**
 * Child process for the cross-process index-lock tests (#2658), using the BUILT
 * module (LOCK_MODULE). Two modes:
 *
 *  - default (HOLD): acquire the lock on LOCK_DIR, write MARKER once held, then
 *    hold until killed. Proves real cross-process exclusion and SIGKILL
 *    kill-recovery against a parent that uses the source module.
 *
 *  - MODE=EXCLUSIVE (SENTINEL set): acquire, then enter a critical section
 *    guarded by an O_EXCL sentinel create — if the sentinel already exists,
 *    another process holds the lock at the same time, which is the exact
 *    single-writer violation the test hunts. Hold briefly, remove the sentinel,
 *    release, exit 0. Exit 3 only if the sentinel was already present (overlap),
 *    exit 4 for other sentinel-create failures, with stderr diagnostics.
 *    Used by the multi-reclaimer test where ≥2 children reclaim one dead holder.
