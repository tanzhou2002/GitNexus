/**
 * #2807 follow-up — a FUNCTION-LOCAL callable must keep its own graph node when
 * the def and the node disagree about the callable LABEL.
 *
 * Swift's structure phase emits a type's methods as `Function` nodes while the
 * scope extractor derives `Method` from the `@declaration.method` anchor. Every
 * key `resolveDefGraphId` builds is scoped to one label, so under that split the
 * position key (#2699) missed AND the fail-closed guard beside it could never
 * fire — the guard is scoped to the def's own label too, so it was unreachable
 * in exactly the case the sibling-label retry below it serves. The local then
 * fell through to that retry and was aliased onto the class method of the same
 * name.
 *
 * Measured before the fix, on this fixture: the local `func helper` inside
 * `Host.run` resolved to `Function:src/app.swift:Host.helper#1`, so the `sink()`
 * call in the LOCAL's body was emitted as an outgoing edge of the public
 * one-argument method — a caller that does not make that call, present in the
 * graph, in a file whose two `helper`s do not even share an arity.
 *
 * The two `helper`s are deliberately given DIFFERENT arities. Arity is the
 * disambiguator every name-keyed bridge lookup falls back on, so a fixture where
 * they matched could pass on a lookup that still cannot tell the two apart.
