/**
 * Production-path regression guard for the Dart import-resolution index (#2879).
 *
 * The basename index (`getDartFileIndex` in `languages/dart/import-target.ts`)
 * is memoized on the `allFilePaths` Set identity via a WeakMap. Resolution
 * reaches it through `dartScopeResolver.resolveImportTarget` — the orchestrator
 * adapter — not by calling `resolveDartImportTarget` directly the way the unit
 * parity test does. The adapter must therefore pass the Set THROUGH; a
 * defensive copy (`new Set(allFilePaths)`) would hand a fresh WeakMap key per
 * call and rebuild the index on every import, restoring the O(imports × files)
 * behaviour this replaced. Python hit exactly that (PR #1918 review P1), and
 * the parity test cannot see it: it never crosses the adapter.
 *
 * Dart is the language the benchmark's measured blind spot was quantified on
 * (`bench/import-target/baselines.json` `_blind_spot`), so its adapter is the
 * one with the least timing cover.
 *
 * The traversal-count assertions are the perf guard. They are paired with
 * result assertions on purpose: a count of 1 is equally true of an adapter that
 * has stopped resolving anything at all, so counting alone would stay green
 * while every Dart IMPORTS edge disappeared.
