/**
 * #2699 — JS/TS `statement_block` scopes, and the false ACCESSES edges they
 * remove.
 *
 * Enabling `(statement_block) @scope.block` for TS/JS dropped 114 ACCESSES
 * edges across a 762-file corpus with `added: 0`. That looked like a
 * regression, so it was measured rather than assumed: all 274 emitting
 * reference sites behind those 114 edges were classified by re-reading the
 * source at the site. Every one of the 114 had at least one site of the form
 * `receiver.name`, and none was bare-identifier-only. (269 sites classified as
 * member reads outright; the 5 remaining were classifier artifacts — the name
 * also occurred earlier on the line, as in `a.b.declLine` for `b` — and are
 * member reads too.) So every dropped edge was a PROPERTY read
 * (`options.baseUrl`) mis-resolving to an unrelated function-local `const` of
 * the same name in the same file.
 *
 * The cause was not block-specific: `lookupCore` Step 1 walked the lexical
 * chain for EVERY lookup, including explicit-receiver property reads, so
 * `options.baseUrl` could bind to a local `baseUrl`. Block scopes narrowed
 * that — they moved a nested-block local off the chain of any reference
 * outside its block — but a local declared directly in the FUNCTION BODY
 * stayed on it, and no amount of extra scopes reaches that case.
 *
 * That residual half is fixed here too: Step 1 is now skipped when the site
 * has a NAMED explicit receiver, since `recv.name` addresses a member of
 * whatever `recv` denotes and never a lexical binding of the bare tail name.
 * The second describe below pins it. What remains, deliberately, is that a
 * `this`/`self` read can still bind lexically to a same-named local — that is
 * the price of keeping the genuine self-alias reads Step 1 resolves correctly
 * (`const self = this; self.member`), which is why those two names are exempt.
 *
 * So these tests pin the change in BOTH directions: a property read must not
 * reach a same-named local, and a real member read must still resolve through
 * the receiver's own type. Deleting the block-scope capture fails the first;
 * over-suppressing — dropping block bindings rather than scoping them, or
 * skipping Step 1 for `this` as well — fails the second.
