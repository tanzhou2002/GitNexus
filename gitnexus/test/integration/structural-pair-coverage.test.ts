/**
 * Corpus-derived coverage for the HAND-DECLARED half of `RELATION_SCHEMA`.
 *
 * `test/unit/schema-pair-coverage.test.ts` derives its requirement from
 * schema.ts's two rules — the scope-resolution bridge cross product, and
 * `DEFINITION_ANCHOR_LABELS × ATTACHMENT_TARGET_LABELS` for the framework and
 * pipeline-phase overlays — so both generated halves are covered there. What
 * neither rule can reach is `STRUCTURAL_PAIR_DDL`: the containment, inheritance
 * and import pairs BETWEEN TWO DEFINITION LABELS. Ten node tables are absent
 * from every rule's target side (`CodeElement`, `Impl`, `Namespace`,
 * `Template`, `TypeAlias`, `Typedef`, `Static`, `Section`, `Folder`, and the
 * PDG-only `BasicBlock` — `Union` left this set when Zig made it a linkable
 * member container), so a pair pointing at one is hand-declared or
 * it does not exist. No predicate describes that surface — any container can
 * hold any definition — so this asks the emitters directly: run the real
 * pipeline and require every FROM/TO pair it produces to be declared.
 *
 * Each entry also pins the pair it exists to guard. Without that the suite is
 * vacuous: `undeclared` is derived from what the pipeline emitted, so a fixture
 * that stopped emitting — renamed directory, grammar that failed to load,
 * swallowed parse error — yields an empty set and passes green while guarding
 * nothing. `sentinels` turns each case from "nothing undeclared" into "this
 * emitter still fires, and everything it emits is declared".
 *
 * Coverage is bounded by `NON_BRIDGE_CORPUS`: a sample, not a proof. A
 * language whose fixture is absent is unguarded, so a new structural emitter
 * should land with an entry here.
 *
 * Deliberately isolated from the resolver suites that already build three of
 * these graphs (`resolvers/cobol.test.ts`, `resolvers/vue.test.ts`,
 * `resolvers/php.test.ts`) — see NOTE below the corpus before re-raising that.

/*
 * NOTE — why this suite runs its own pipelines instead of reusing the resolver

 *
 *   1. Vitest runs with `pool: 'forks'` and default isolation, so every test
 *      FILE gets its own child process. A fixture-keyed result cache in
 *      `resolvers/helpers.ts` would be per-file module state and would share
 *      nothing across files — zero saving.
 *   2. The graphs are not interchangeable. `resolvers/cobol.test.ts` builds
 *      cobol-app with `{ skipGraphPhases: true }`, which drops the phase-emitted
 *      edges (`Function|Process`, `Function|Community`, and the whole class of
 *      pair `mcp-tool-class` exists to guard: HANDLES_TOOL is a pipeline phase).
 *      Asserting there would silently cover LESS surface than here.
 *   3. Half the corpus has no existing home anyway, and the cases run
 *      concurrently, so they overlap into roughly one fixture's wall time: all
 *      6 measured ~6s of test time against the ~16s this file spends on
 *      transform+import before the first case starts. Hosting only the 3
 *      homeless ones measured ~5s — a ~1s saving that still cannot remove a
 *      file, so it cannot remove that ~16s.
