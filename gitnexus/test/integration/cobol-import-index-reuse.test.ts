/**
 * Production-path regression guard for the COBOL `COPY`-target index (#2908).
 *
 * The two-tier basename index (`getCobolCopyIndex` in
 * `languages/cobol/scope-resolver.ts`) is memoized on the `allFilePaths` Set
 * identity via a WeakMap, so the file set must be passed THROUGH from the
 * orchestrator, never copied. A defensive `new Set(allFilePaths)` in the
 * adapter hands a fresh WeakMap key per call and rebuilds the index on every
 * `COPY`, restoring the O(copies × files) scans this replaced — the exact bug
 * PR #1918 shipped for Python and had to fix in review (P1).
 *
 * COBOL is the language where that copy costs the most: every `COPY` used to
 * run TWO full scans, and mainframe repos are copybook-dense — one program can
 * carry dozens of `COPY` statements.
 *
 * Unlike the other languages in this family, COBOL has no separate
 * `resolve<Lang>ImportTarget` function; the adapter IS the resolver. The unit
 * parity test (`test/unit/scope-resolution/cobol-import-target-parity.test.ts`)
 * therefore reaches the same entry point — but it says nothing about Set
 * identity, so a copy inserted there leaves every one of its arms green. This
 * file is what notices, by counting traversals of the set.
 *
 * The traversal-count assertions are the perf guard. They are paired with
 * result assertions on purpose: a count of 1 is equally true of an adapter that
 * has stopped resolving anything at all, so counting alone would stay green
 * while every COBOL COPY edge disappeared.
 *
 * Expected count is 1: both tiers are filled in a single pass over the set.
