/**
 * Integration test for issue #2338 (LadybugDB/ladybug#605 validation):
 * directly exercises the `TransactionManager` lock-order-inversion deadlock
 * between a `commit()`-triggered auto-checkpoint and a concurrent
 * `beginAutoTransaction()` — the race #605 fixes — under a shape close to
 * GitNexus's real concurrent-writer load.
 *
 * Deliberately bypasses `conn-lock.ts`/`lbug-adapter.ts`'s singleton: this
 * test opens its own `Database` at a fresh temp path and multiple raw
 * `Connection`s directly against `@ladybugdb/core`, so it proves the
 * *native* engine no longer deadlocks — not merely that GitNexus's app-level
 * serialization hides the problem. Production still routes every write
 * through the single serialized connection (see `conn-lock.ts`); this test
 * does not change that. It does reuse `lbug-config.ts`'s `createLbugDatabase`
 * for the constructor call itself, so it stays in sync with any future
 * signature change instead of hand-maintaining a second copy of the
 * positional arg list.
 *
 * Empirical grounding:
 *  - A pure-writer connection loop, even with a tiny `checkpointThreshold`,
 *    never produced a `.shadow` sidecar in local probing — `.shadow` is a
 *    "non-blocking concurrent checkpoint sidecar" (bridge-db.ts) that only
 *    appears when a checkpoint races a *concurrent reader*. Writers alone
 *    don't force it; this test mixes writer and reader connections.
 *  - LadybugDB enforces "only one write transaction at a time" as an
 *    immediate error (`Only one write transaction...`), not a blocking wait —
 *    so true overlapping write *attempts* (the shape needed to stress the
 *    #605 handoff) require each writer to retry on that specific error.
 *    Zero-delay hammering across 4 concurrent writers instead tripped a
 *    different native guard ("Timeout waiting for active write transactions
 *    to leave the system before checkpointing") by never giving the
 *    checkpoint a gap to find zero active writers. 2 writers with a small,
 *    guaranteed non-zero jittered retry delay (1-3ms via `withRetry`'s
 *    `afterMs` override — validated across 12 consecutive local runs) avoids
 *    that guard while still reliably forcing the checkpoint-vs-reader race.
 *    NOTE: `isDbBusyError` (lbug-config.ts) does NOT recognize this specific
 *    "Only one write transaction..." message (its substring list is 'busy'/
 *    'lock'/'already in use') — GitNexus's production write-retry path
 *    (`withLbugDb`) would not retry on it today. Documented as a known gap
 *    in GUARDRAILS.md/RUNBOOK.md; out of scope to fix here since it's a
 *    production-code change beyond this validation test.
 *  - This exact test configuration was run against @ladybugdb/core 0.17.1
 *    (pre-#605) as a comparison: 1 of 4 runs hung for the full
 *    DEADLOCK_TIMEOUT_MS and failed — a direct reproduction of the
 *    lock-order-inversion deadlock, consistent with #605's own description
 *    of it as timing-dependent, not deterministic. 9 consecutive runs
 *    against 0.18.0 (post-#605) all passed cleanly (~2.5-4s each). This
 *    comparison is not asserted in CI (a 0.17.1 install isn't part of this
 *    suite going forward); see commit 91e583a5's message for the full
 *    run-count record.
