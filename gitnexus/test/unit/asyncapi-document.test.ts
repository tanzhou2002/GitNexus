/**
 * The pure half of AsyncAPI reading: version gating, the two-source broker
 * reading, the address rules, and the refusal taxonomy.
 *
 * DIRECTION IS PINNED HARDEST, because it is the one error this module can
 * make that leaves everything looking healthy. A reversed `send`/`receive`
 * mapping still emits both roles, still emits every edge, and still produces a
 * connected graph — only with every arrow backwards. An assertion that a node
 * or an operation EXISTS passes identically under both readings, so every
 * direction test below asserts the action itself.
 *
 * THE REFUSALS ARE PINNED AS HARD AS THE ACCEPTANCES. Every one of them is a
 * case where the document says something that looks like an address and is not
 * one; accepting it would connect two services that have said nothing about
 * each other, and a false connection is reported as a fact where a missing one
 * is visible as a gap. A refusal with no test is a refusal one refactor away
 * from silently becoming an acceptance.
