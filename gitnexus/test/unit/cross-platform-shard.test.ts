/**
 * Pins the weight-aware split behind the cross-platform matrix (#2449).
 *
 * The regression this guards is specific and was expensive: three CHEAP files
 * were registered in `SPAWN_CLI`, vitest re-partitioned the list by file COUNT,
 * and the reshuffle clustered `cli-e2e` (now 621 s on Windows) with `cli-limit-e2e`
 * (75 s) and `analyze-heap-oom-e2e` (23 s) on one shard, which then blew the
 * 20-minute watchdog. The added files cost nothing; the COUNT-split did it.
 *
 * So the load-bearing case here is not "the split is even" — it is
 * "adding a cheap file does not move a heavy one". A partition that merely
 * balanced totals could still reshuffle everything on every insertion and would
 * reproduce the outage exactly.
