/**
 * `readRegistry` used to answer every failure with `[]`.
 *
 * For a listing that is harmless — an unreadable registry and an empty one look
 * the same in `gitnexus list`, and both print nothing. For a caller that *acts*
 * on emptiness it is not: `syncGroup` derives `missingRepos` from this list, and
 * an all-missing sync is allowed to write, so an EACCES after a
 * `sudo gitnexus analyze`, a truncated registry.json, or an $HOME-on-NFS blip
 * turned "I could not read the registry" into the factual claim "no repo is
 * registered" — and replaced a good contracts.json with an empty one at exit 0.
 *
 * That is an unreadable condition reported as missing: the same conflation
 * #3011 removes one stack frame further down, which is why `readRegistryStrict`
 * exists and why syncGroup is the only caller that uses it. It is a separate
 * export rather than an option on `readRegistry` so that every lenient call
 * site keeps a provably untouched signature.
 *
 * ENOENT stays lenient in both modes. No file genuinely means nothing has been
 * registered yet, and every first-run path depends on that.
