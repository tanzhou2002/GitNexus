/**
 * One property, asserted for EVERY registered `ScopeResolver` (#2909).
 *
 * Import-target resolution must not re-derive its per-pass workspace structures
 * once per import. The per-language guards matching
 * `test/integration/*-import-index-reuse.test.ts` say that once each, with their
 * own corpus, their own expected traversal count and their own header — and
 * there is one only for the languages someone wrote one for, never for the rest,
 * because adding a resolver to `SCOPE_RESOLVERS` is two lines
 * (`pipeline/registry.ts`), neither of which is a test. This file closes that
 * gap without restating its size: the table below is keyed by
 * `SupportedLanguages`, and the inventory arm diffs its keys against
 * `SCOPE_RESOLVERS` so a registered resolver missing from it fails.
 *
 * ## Called the way the ORCHESTRATOR calls, with all five arguments
 *
 * `pipeline/run.ts` passes five: `(targetRaw, fromFile, allFilePaths,
 * resolutionConfig, { parsedFiles, parsedImport })`. This file used to pass
 * four, and a fifth argument that is never supplied is a channel that is never
 * measured — `languages/php/import-target.ts` returns early on `context ===
 * undefined`, so everything behind that guard was ungated for every language in
 * the table. Replacing PHP's `perFileSet` with an identity wrapper, which
 * rebuilds its `Map<dirAlias, ParsedFile[]>` per import at O(files × depth)
 * (197.0 µs → 9976.2 µs per import at 8000 files, depth 6), left every arm of
 * this file green. Both call sites below now pass a `context`, and the fixtures
 * name their `parsedImport` explicitly so no adapter's use of the channel can
 * hide behind an omission.
 *
 * ## Two counters, because there are two per-file-set KEYS
 *
 * `perFileSet` memoizes on object identity, and the orchestrator threads two
 * stable objects per pass: the `allFilePaths` Set and the `parsedFiles` array.
 * A `CountingSet` sees only the first, and the readers of the second touch the
 * Set nowhere while reading it, so `scans` moves by ZERO for anything that goes
 * wrong on that key — measured, with the identity-wrapper mutation above:
 * `scans` 1 and 1, `parsedFileReads` 9 and 603. Hence `countedParsedFiles`
 * (`test/helpers/counting-file-set.ts`), and hence the same comparison asserted
 * twice, once per key.
 *
 * Four registered resolvers read `context` — PHP and Python for declaration
 * filtering, and Java and Kotlin for declared-package indexes. Every other
 * adapter declares three or four parameters and cannot observe a fifth. Which
 * ones those are is not a number to maintain here: the per-language
 * `minimumParsedFileReads` floor in the table IS the record, and it is what a
 * new reader has to change. Every language that reads this key memoizes on it,
 * and the memos fail differently:
 *
 *   - PHP: the `filesByDirectory` memo, `perFileSet`-keyed on the `parsedFiles`
 *     array. Defeat it and every import rebuilds a `Map<dirAlias,
 *     ParsedFile[]>`; the arm reads 603 against 9 (proven by mutation).
 *   - Python: `parsedFileByPath`, keyed the same way, behind
 *     `pythonFileExportsName`. It is built by the FIRST import whose package
 *     probe resolves — one pass over the array — and every later one is a
 *     `Map.get`, so the floor of 1 is that single build and the equality half
 *     is what proves it does not repeat. Before that memo the same call was a
 *     `parsedFiles.find` per resolving import, which is the shape #2901
 *     removed on the file-set key; this arm is why it cannot come back.
 *   - Java and Kotlin: declared-package/module-binding indexes, each built once
 *     from the stable `parsedFiles` identity and reused across all imports.
 *   - Every other language: `0 === 0`, recorded as a floor of 0. A new reader
 *     arrives with that floor already in place and is caught by the equality
 *     half, which needs no per-language knowledge at all.
 *
 * The shared benchmark now exercises the same five-argument production call;
 * this deterministic counter remains the stronger memo-reuse assertion.
 *
 * ## The assertion is a COMPARISON, not a constant
 *
 * `scans(200) === scans(2)`, never `scans === 1`. Per-language counts legitimately
 * differ — C# and Java each build two indexes over the same Set, TypeScript /
 * JavaScript / Vue materialize an array and a copy behind their pass cache, Rust
 * never traverses at all — and a table of expected constants would be one entry
 * per language to get wrong. Comparing two counts against each other
 * needs no per-language knowledge and states the actual property: the traversal
 * count is a function of the FILE SET, not of the import count.
 *
 * ## Paired with non-vacuity, because the comparison alone is trivially true
 *
 * `scans(200) === scans(2)` holds perfectly for a resolver that returns `null`
 * without ever touching the set — which is exactly what an adapter looks like
 * after its context narrowing starts rejecting the workspace (`instanceof Set`
 * for C# and Java, the `has`/iterator duck-type for Swift). So each case also
 * asserts:
 *
 *   - `hitTarget` still resolves to something. This is the same pairing rule the
 *     `test/integration/*-import-index-reuse.test.ts` guards state in their
 *     headers, and the reason `CountingSet` is a real `Set` subclass rather than
 *     a counter object.
 *   - the count clears `minimumScans`, which proves the counting Set is the
 *     object the resolver actually indexed rather than a copy made upstream.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT cover
 *
 * The fixtures are minimal by design — a handful of files and two import
 * spellings per language, enough to reach the index and no more. Output parity,
 * tie-breaks and iteration order are the subject of
 * `import-target-index-parity.test.ts` and the per-language parity tests; the
 * per-language integration guards carry the realistic corpora and the exact
 * expected traversal counts. This file only answers "does the work stay flat in
 * the number of imports", for every resolver `SCOPE_RESOLVERS` registers.
 *
 * Neither counter sees inside a structure once it has been built: a scan over
 * `WorkspaceFileIndex.normalized`, or over a `ParsedFile[]` bucket in PHP's
 * directory index, moves nothing (see `test/helpers/counting-file-set.ts`).
 * That is not hypothetical — JavaScript's adapter had no suffix
 * index at all until #2910, so every JavaScript import ran `suffixResolve`'s
 * linear pass over the materialized `normalizedFileList` (6448.9 µs per import
 * at 2000 files, against 25.0 µs for TypeScript), and the `javascript` case
 * below scored a clean pass throughout: the pass cache WAS reused, so the
 * traversal count read 2 either way. What catches that class of defect is a
 * behaviour or call-count assertion, not a traversal count — see
 * `test/integration/javascript-import-index-reuse.test.ts` and
 * `test/unit/scope-resolution/javascript-import-target-parity.test.ts`.

/**
 * Registered resolvers exempted from the property, each citing the issue that

 *
 * It was EMPTY until #2953, and that emptiness was a result rather than a
 * starting state: every resolver in `SCOPE_RESOLVERS` either memoized its index
 * on the `allFilePaths` Set identity or never traversed the Set at all (#2872,
 * #2877, #2878, #2879, #2880, #2901, #2902, #2908 closed the last of them).
 *
 * The three entries it now carries are a different KIND of exemption, and the
 * distinction is the reason this comment is worth reading. They are not "this
 * resolver is allowed to re-scan": TypeScript, JavaScript and Vue stopped
 * deriving anything from the file set at all, so there is no per-pass structure
 * for the property to be about. `Set.has` against a candidate the config named
 * is O(1) and independent of workspace size, which is the outcome the
 * per-import-scan ban existed to secure.
 *
 * The mechanism stays because it is the point — a language must not be able to
 * opt out by quietly not appearing in `FIXTURES`. An entry must cite an issue
 * (`#NNNN`), and the key list is pinned exactly, so both adding one and letting
 * one rot are visible, reviewed edits rather than lines in a table nobody
 * reads.
