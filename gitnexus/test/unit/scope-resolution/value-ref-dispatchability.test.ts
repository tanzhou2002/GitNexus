/**
 * Canary for the invariant that `callableValueReferenceBoundaries`' dispatch
 * exclusion silently depends on (#3219 review round 3).
 *
 * The exclusion, in `mcp/local/local-backend.ts`: a target with an inbound
 * `property-dispatch` CALLS edge is NOT hedged, because the analyzer followed
 * the registration and nothing was missed. It is symbol-level, not edge-level —
 * the graph does not record which registration produced which synthesized call.
 *
 * That is only sound while no single symbol can carry BOTH kinds of
 * registration, and today none can, for a reason that lives nowhere near the
 * exclusion:
 *
 *   - `emitPropertyDispatchCalls` synthesizes a CALLS edge only for a
 *     registration whose site carries a `propertyKey` (sweep 1 skips the
 *     registration index when it is undefined; sweep 2 reads only that index).
 *   - Every JS/TS `@reference.value-ref` rule also captures
 *     `@reference.property-key` — both are object-literal shapes.
 *   - No Zig `@reference.value-ref` rule captures one: Zig has no
 *     object-literal key to dispatch through.
 *
 * So a dispatchable registration is always a JS/TS one and an undispatchable
 * registration is always a Zig one, and the two cannot meet on one symbol.
 *
 * The day that stops being true — a JS/TS rule for a bare callback argument
 * (`register(handler)`), a Zig rule that grows a key — a symbol CAN have both,
 * and the exclusion starts publishing `exact` over a registration the analyzer
 * provably did not follow. That is the #3399 defect returning through a side
 * door, and it would not fail a single existing test.
 *
 * This test fails instead. If it fails, do not relax it: go and decide what
 * `callableValueReferenceBoundaries` should do about a mixed symbol (the
 * options are recorded at the exclusion site), then update this file.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, stated so the green tick is not read as more than it
 * is. It reads query SOURCES, so a capture synthesized in code rather than
 * matched by a rule — the mechanism `@reference.static-gated` uses — can break
 * the partition with this test green. A provider adding one has to come here by
 * hand. Languages that own no query and delegate to another's captures (Vue →
 * `emitTsScopeCaptures` / `emitJsScopeCaptures`) are covered transitively, by
 * the rules they borrow, which is why the last case asserts on query OWNERS
 * rather than on the set of languages that can emit a value-ref.
