/**
 * B2 — a refresh that reports SUCCESS while leaving the index unusable.
 *
 * The dangerous variant of a broken refresh: metadata IS written, so the index
 * reads as fresh, hooks re-arm, and every tool answers from a graph missing
 * most of its edges — which is indistinguishable from a codebase that
 * genuinely has no such relationships. Observed as edges collapsing
 * 23009 -> 2170, and as a `CodeRelation` table that never materialized (which
 * reads back as a persisted count of zero).
 *
 * `analyze` compares the relationship count the pipeline produced against what
 * the DB hands back after the write and records `graphWriteCollapsed`. This
 * covers the translation of that record into the operator-facing reason, which
 * is what `status` and the MCP resources report.

  // The old assertion read `detectGraphWriteCollapse(1000, 4000)` with the
  // comment "PDG layers write into the same table, so persisted > expected is
  // normal". True about the table — and it quietly licensed the masking. The
  // caller passed `stats.edges`, a count of EVERY CodeRelation row, against an
  // expectation covering only the structural halves, so losing all 1,000
  // structural edges while 4,000 PDG rows persisted was indistinguishable from
  // health.
  //
  // Padding `expected` with the PDG rows does NOT fix that, which is worth
  // recording because it is the obvious move: 4,000 persisted against 5,000
  // expected still clears the 0.5 ratio. The ratio would be judging a minority
  // population. `run-analyze.ts` therefore compares STRUCTURAL against
  // STRUCTURAL, using the new `getLbugStats().structuralEdges`.
  //
