  // 35 -> 36 for the bound-callable start-line join (#2735), 36 -> 37 for
  // Java/Kotlin Spring AOP capture side-channels (#2416), 37 -> 38 for the Swift
  // conditional-directive parse-semantics change (#2771), 38 -> 39 for
  // receiver-chain wire format v2: every persisted chain string changed prefix
  // and a v2 decoder refuses v1 by design, so a stale cache replays chains this
  // build silently discards. 39 -> 40 for inference-typed field captures in six
  // languages (#2807) — all parse-time emission, so a warm cache replays the
  // pre-fix capture set for byte-unchanged files and the new receiver edges
  // never appear.
  //
  // This pin has now earned its keep EIGHT times, and twice it caught an EXACT
  // clash rather than a near-miss: main took 37 for #2416 while this branch
  // already used 37, and then took 38 for #2771 after this branch had moved to
  // 38. Both times two incompatible schemas claimed one number. Note when the
  // second clash was caught — after review, while the branch sat waiting to
  // merge — which is precisely the window in which `main` allocates. Re-check
  // against origin/main immediately before merge, not at review time.
  // Moved 42 -> 43 for #2813's `@reference.embedded-pointer` capture, which is
  // parse-time emission and so cannot be served from a v42 warm cache.
  // Moved 43 -> 44 for #2842's TypeScript heritage capture (interface and
  // abstract-class `@reference.inherits`), which is parse-time emission and so
  // cannot be served from a v43 warm cache.
  // Moved 44 -> 45 for #2837 (Go struct/interface captures re-anchored from
  // `type_declaration` to `type_spec`). This branch first took 44 and COLLIDED
  // with #2842 above, which merged first — the ninth entry in the ledger and the
  // third EXACT clash. Note what this pin could and could not do: it cannot
  // detect the tie (both branches asserted `toBe(44)`, which passes when main is
  // already 44); only the merge-time diff against origin/main surfaced it. What
  // the pin DOES do is fail loudly the moment the constant and this expectation
  // drift apart, which is what forces the re-check to happen at all.
  // Moved 45 -> 46 for the JavaScript bare-identifier read captures, the
  // object-literal `@definition.property` rule and the TypeScript shape-member
  // captures (A1/A2/A4/A5) — all parse-time, so a v45 warm cache serves entries
  // carrying neither the new reference sites nor the new Property nodes.
  //
  // This branch first took 45 and COLLIDED with #2837 above, which merged
  // first: the TENTH ledger entry and the FOURTH exact clash, and the second in
  // a row. Same lesson as the note above — the pin cannot detect the tie, since
  // both sides asserted `toBe(45)` and that passes while main is already 45.
  // Only the merge-time diff against origin/main surfaces it.
  //
  // Moved 46 -> 47 for method-level Spring `@RequestMapping` routes (#2857):
  // cached ParseWorkerResults otherwise replay the pre-fix empty route set.
  // That PR read this branch's claim on 46 and took 47 rather than colliding —
  // the FIFTH clash, and the first the ledger's convention actually prevented.
  // It only moved the collision up one step, though: this branch's own 47 and
  // everything above it had to be renumbered +1 at merge time. Capture sets
  // unchanged; only the numbers moved.
  //
  // Moved 51 -> 52 for dispatch-guard routes (R3-7): the JS/TS providers now
  // implement `extractDecoratorRoutes`, and decorator routes are worker output
  // carried in the cache. A v50 warm cache replays a worker result whose
  // `decoratorRoutes` predates the extractor, so `route_map` keeps answering
  // empty — the exact symptom the change fixes, disguised as "it does not work".
  // Moved 52 -> 53 for the same-file constant folding that followed, because a
  // build stamped 50 (now 52) had already been used to analyze without it.
  //
  //
  // Moved 47 -> 48 for #2833's three parse-time changes: C++
  // `field_declaration` captures for `template_type` and qualified generic
  // member types (those members had NO type binding before), a Python interpret
  // change that reduces `Repo[User]` to `Repo` in `TypeRef.rawName`, and the new
  // `SymbolDefinition.typeParameters` field read from a
  // `@declaration.type-parameters` capture in six languages. All three are
  // serialized into the cached ParsedFile, so an older warm cache replays
  // pre-fix bindings and the fix is a silent no-op on incremental analyze while
  // every cold-run test still passes.
  //
  // 48, not 46, because this branch collided TWICE: it staged 46 and then 47,
  // both free when written, and by merge time #2856 claimed 46 and #2857 took 47
  // and merged first. This assertion is exactly what CANNOT detect that — the
  // branch asserted `toBe(47)` and so did #2857, and both passed. What this pin
  // does do is fail loudly the moment the constant and this expectation drift
  // apart, which is what forces the merge-time diff against origin/main to
  // happen at all.
  // Moved 53 -> 54 for W2-8: type parameters are captured on generic functions
  // and aliases, not just class-likes, so the shadowing guard has data to read.
  // Moved 54 -> 55 for W2-9: the dispatch-guard verb walk tracks boolean polarity,
  // so a ternary can no longer report the verb it excludes. Routes are emitted at
  // parse time, so a warm cache would replay the inverted verb indefinitely.
  // Moved 55 -> 56 for R3-8 part 1: the verb walk returns every method a guard
  // serves, so a multi-method guard emits several routes where it emitted one.
  // Moved 56 -> 57 for R3-8 part 2: `.match()` dispatch, bound-match test sites,
  // named regex consts, and capturing segment wildcards in `regexToRoutePath`.
  // Moved 57 -> 58 for #2897: fetch sites are captured without a literal URL.
  // Moved 58 -> 59 for the #2899 review follow-up: the dispatch-guard walk keys
  // match bindings on (enclosing function, name) instead of the bare identifier,
  // and a ternary conjunction INTERSECTS its operands instead of taking the first
  // non-empty set. Both strictly remove routes, so a warm cache would keep
  // serving a fabricated verbed route that evicts the true one.
  // Moved 59 -> 60 for #2864's `ParsedImport.reexportsName` and the
  // `@import.publishes` capture gating it — a serialized ParsedFile field AND a
  // capture change, the first being the easy-to-miss half. 60 was staged while
  // main was 53, chosen above every in-flight MAXIMUM rather than at main + 1;
  // #2899 then cascaded main to 59, and 60 survived only because of that choice.
  // Moved 60 -> 62 for the cycle-checker fix's two optional `ParsedImport`
  // fields, `typeOnly` and `runsOnlyWhenCalled`. Neither is a capture, but
  // `parsedfile-store.ts` serializes the whole ParsedFile generically, so both
  // are part of the cached shape — the same half of #2864 that was easy to miss.
  // A warm cache would replay untagged imports, the strict `=== true` reads
  // would take the untagged path, and `check --cycles` would keep reporting the
  // erased and deferred imports the branch exists to stop reporting: a silent
  // no-op on incremental analyze while every cold-run test passes.
  // Main subsequently advanced through 63. Values above it must remain distinct
  // from both published branch heads and every active in-flight claim.
  // Moved 63 -> 64 for Java enum and annotated heritage captures (#2918),
  // then 64 -> 66 for the synthetic-declaration sidecar, both now on main.
  // Moved 66 -> 67 for #2917's implicit Java record-component accessor
  // definitions and scope declarations. This branch staged 65 before #2918's 66
  // landed; 67 is the next free value above every in-flight claim (main 66,
  // #2939's 64), re-checked against the claims rather than against main alone.
  // Moved 67 -> 68 for #2912's `ReferenceSite.typeArguments` — heritage generic
  // arguments derived at extraction time, so a warm cache replays `inherits`
  // sites without them and instantiation-aware dispatch degrades silently to
  // the pre-fix fan-out. This branch staged 64 above the claims live at the
  // time (61, 62, 63); all three landed and cascaded main to 67, so 68 is the
  // next free value above every claim at merge — the rule, re-applied.
  // Version 69 added #2969's JS/TS data-route-table decoratorRoutes. Version 70
  // adds Spring non-HTTP handler side-channel facts (#2417 / #2891), so it is
  // the next free value after both cache payload changes.
  // Moved 70 -> 71 for #2980's Java constant-route capture set (moduleConstants
  // + routePathOperands). 72 -> 74 added import-proven Convex endpoint metadata,
  // skipping 73 because open PR #3046 claims it.
  // Version 75 adds #3009's NestJS decorator routes to the same JS/TS
  // decoratorRoutes channel, so a warm pre-feature cache cannot replay the empty
  // route set that change fixes. This branch originally claimed 71; origin/main
  // cascaded past it (71 to #2980, 74 to Convex) while the PR was open, so 71
  // would now be BELOW main and the reuse gate would never fire. 75 is the next
  // free value above origin/main and above every in-flight claim (#3046 at 73,
  // #1616 at a stale 2) — the rule, re-applied at merge, not at authoring time.
  // Moved 75 -> 76 within this same branch for the NestJS array form, then
  // 76 -> 77 because 76 turned out not to be free: origin/main reached 76 via
  // #3046 while this branch was in review, and package.json is 1.6.9 on both
  // sides, so the cache key was the byte-identical `76+1.6.9` on two branches
  // with incompatible worker output. #3046 had skipped 75 precisely because
  // this branch held it. Two PRs each doing the bookkeeping correctly still
  // collided, because each re-checked once and neither re-checked after the
  // other moved — which is why the rule is re-applied AT MERGE, not when the
  // number is picked.
  // Moved 89 -> 90 for #2865's decorator-route `handlerName` after #3128
  // merged and took 89. origin/main is 89; 90 is the next free value and
  // still unused by other open PRs' parse-cache.ts heads — the same
  // collision the paragraph above describes, caught this time by re-checking
  // at merge.
  // Moved 90 -> 91 for #3130's Kotlin Spring decoratorRoutes and Kotlin
  // ModuleConstants shadow metadata, both persisted worker output.
  // Moved 91 -> 92 for #1432 (Zig): the shared callable-flow reader's member-call
  // capture facts change for Kotlin / C++ / C# / TypeScript, and Zig is captured
  // for the first time with rules that moved within the PR — a warm cache from
  // an earlier head of that branch replayed the old facts across `--force`.
  // Moved 92 -> 93 for #3161 (Zig static gating): call captures inside a
  // comptime-false branch gain the `@reference.static-gated` marker, a
  // parse-time fact a warm cache from an earlier head would replay without.
  // Moved 94 -> 95 for #3179: Objective-C framework-import-only header
  // classification changed parse-worker output for the same file content.
  // Moved 95 -> 96 for #3179: Objective-C macro-marker preprocessing now
  // recognizes form feed and vertical tab as C preprocessing whitespace.
  // Moved 96 -> 97 for #3179: comment-prefixed directives and invalid numeric
  // marker prefixes change the parse-time normalization result.
  // Moved 97 -> 98 for #3219 (Zig callable-value references): `ZIG_SCOPE_QUERY`
  // gained three `@reference.value-ref` rules, so a `.zig` file now yields
  // `value-ref` entries in `ParsedFile.referenceSites` where it yielded none.
  // A warm pre-v98 cache replays the old, empty site list for every unchanged
  // file — `--force` included, since shards are content-addressed — so no USES
  // edge is emitted, the boundary probe measures a real zero, and `impact` on a
  // registered accessor goes back to `epistemic: "exact"`: the #3399 defect,
  // silently un-fixed on exactly the incremental path most users are on.
  // Moved 98 -> 99 for #3190: lexical import provenance and corrected export
  // evidence. origin/main took 98 for #3219 and 99 for #3190.
  // Moved 99 -> 100 for #3253: retain absolute Rust import qualifiers.
  // Moved 100 -> 101 for #3294 review: retain keyword glob paths and distinguish
  // restricted pub(...) imports from unrestricted reexports.
  // Moved 101 -> 102 for #3273: preserve exact call-result assignment facts
  // required by post-resolution Swift return-type replay.
  // Moved 102 -> 103 for #3339 review: tRPC route extraction changed —
  // nested-router paths, a tightened entry gate, and controller-less routes
  // now bind handlers via a same-file CALLS edge. Warm caches replay the flat
  // pre-fix capture set verbatim, so both stores re-extract.
  // Moved 103 -> 104 for #3339 review: pair-HOC queries name
  // `mutation(withAuth(arrow))` object-pair handlers. Warm caches replay
  // anonymous arrows, so both stores re-extract.
  // Moved 104 -> 112 for #3354: callable-value flow follows `??`/`||`/`?:`
  // branches. 105-111 are claimed by open PR #3326.
  // Moved 112 -> 113 for #3371: notebook code-cell extraction before Python parse.
  // Moved 113 -> 114 for #2965: C/C++ angle includes survive interpret as
