/**
 * U10 (M6 from PR #1693 review) — Cumulative-timeout exhaustion is
 * actually enforced.
 *
 * `worker-pool-resilience.test.ts` already pins the *default value* of
 * `maxCumulativeTimeoutMs` (5x `subBatchIdleTimeoutMs`). What it does
 * NOT verify is that dispatch ACTUALLY aborts the offending job when
 * the cumulative wall-clock budget is exhausted — without this test,
 * a future refactor could remove the exhaustion branch in
 * `requeueAfterTimeout` and the existing suite would stay green while
 * the pool sat in retry loops for an hour on a real production stall.
 *
 * Scenario: single file, every dispatch idle-times-out. The pool's
 * exponential backoff would normally retry forever; the cumulative
 * ceiling should short-circuit on the first timeout retry attempt
 * (the next backoff would exceed the cap) and surface the file via
 * the quarantine snapshot.
