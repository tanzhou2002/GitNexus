/**
 * `suppressedMatchStages` — what a sync says about the stages it was told to skip.
 *
 * `--exact-only` / `exactOnly` suppresses the wildcard matching stage. The
 * registry it writes is otherwise indistinguishable from one where that stage
 * ran and matched nothing, and `group_impact` / cross-repo `trace` read that
 * registry as authoritative. So the sync has to say so.
 *
 * The tri-state is the same one `unreadableRepos` uses, and the reason is the
 * same: ABSENT means a registry written before the field existed and therefore
 * has no opinion; EMPTY is a measurement — this run suppressed nothing;
 * POPULATED names the stages. Normalizing absent to `[]` would report an
 * unmeasured registry as a clean one.
 *
 * Two properties here are easy to get wrong and are pinned deliberately:
 * the returned result carries the marker on EVERY outcome (the sync really did
 * skip the stage whatever happened to the file), while the persisted registry
 * stamps it only on the outcome that writes this run's contracts.
