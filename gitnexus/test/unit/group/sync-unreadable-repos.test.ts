/**
 * A repo that is registered but whose index cannot be opened must not be

 *
 * The failure this pins: `syncGroup` wrapped `initLbug` + extraction in a bare
 * `catch {}` that pushed the repo onto `missingRepos` and discarded the error.
 * A LadybugDB storage-version mismatch therefore surfaced as "repo not found",
 * `group sync` printed `0 contracts, 0 cross-links` and exited 0, and the
 * existing registry was overwritten with an empty one.
 *
 * Three of these cases exist because mutation testing showed the original four
 * could not see the change they were named after:
 *  - a two-repo case, because with exactly one configured repo
 *    `unreadableRepos.length === configuredRepoCount` holds whenever anything
 *    fails, so deleting the `=== configuredRepoCount` conjunct — turning "every
 *    repo failed" into "any repo failed" — passed everything;
 *  - an all-missing case, because deleting the `unreadableRepos.length > 0`
 *    conjunct was caught only by a 9.7 s integration test in another directory;
 *  - a log assertion, because deleting both `logger.warn` calls — the entire
 *    stated purpose of the change — passed everything too.

/**
 * The preserve path rewrites `contracts.json` and deliberately does NOT rebuild

 * so rebuilding it from an extraction that read nothing is the one write that
 * could lose them.
 *
 * But `meta.json`, not `contracts.json`, is where `runGroupImpact` reads
 * completeness from. Leaving it alone therefore left the two files telling
 * different stories: `contracts.json` said "this sync could not read app/backend"
 * while a cross-repo query, reading the previous sync's metadata, answered
 * `{ cross: [], truncated: false }` — fully accounted for. That is a confident
 * wrong answer about the exact thing the completeness channel exists to make
 * legible, and it is what R6 forbids.
 *
 * Refreshing the metadata is not free, though, and the naive version of it is
 * worse than the bug. This file rewrites `meta.json` ATOMICALLY, so its mtime
 * becomes now while `bridge.lbug`'s stays old — which is precisely the shape
 * the unstamped write-order rule ACCEPTS. A refresh that just carried the old
 * fields forward would therefore LAUNDER a pair that was already broken into
 * one that passes `bridgeMetaMatchesFile`. Hence the explicit marker, and hence
 * the cases below that pin a broken pair as still broken afterwards.
