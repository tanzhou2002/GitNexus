/**
 * `--exact-only` / `exactOnly` had the same defect this PR removes
 * `skipEmbeddings` for: it was declared on `SyncOptions`, threaded through the
 * CLI and the MCP tool, and never read. A sync asked for exact matching only
 * still ran the wildcard stage and still emitted `matchType: 'wildcard'`
 * cross-links, so the flag was a promise the pipeline never kept.
 *
 * It is kept (rather than deleted alongside the never-built BM25/embedding
 * stages) because the stage it names does exist, so the flag describes a real
 * choice. These two cases run the SAME synthetic input through `syncGroup`
 * twice and differ only in the flag, so the wildcard link is the only thing
 * that can move between them.
