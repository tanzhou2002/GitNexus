/**
 * What `group_sync` and `group_contracts` PUT ON THE WIRE.
 *
 * Both tools document fields an agent is expected to branch on, and both build
 * their payload by hand — a literal per field, each one a line that can be
 * deleted without breaking a type or a build. Nothing asserted either payload,
 * so dropping `unreadableRepos` or `registryOutcome` from the sync response, or
 * the truncation triple from the contract listing, was a silent change: the
 * caller simply stopped being told, and every existing test stayed green.
 *
 * Hence exact-shape assertions throughout. `toMatchObject` — which is what the
 * one existing `groupSync` assertion uses, in
 * `test/integration/group/group-service-sync-lazy-import.test.ts` — passes
 * happily on a payload that has lost a key, which is precisely the regression
 * this file exists to catch.
 *
 * The tri-state these cases pin, established by the sibling commits in this PR:
 *
 *  - an ABSENT `unreadableRepos` means the sync never recorded which repos it
 *    could read, so any answer derived from the artifact is a floor;
 *  - an EMPTY list is a measurement — this sync accounted for every repo;
 *  - a POPULATED list names the repos whose contracts are not in there.
 *
 * `groupContracts` therefore OMITS the key in the absent case rather than
 * inventing `[]`, and pairs it with `truncated: true` +
 * `truncationReason: 'incomplete-sync'` + `riskEpistemic: 'lower-bound'`. An
 * exact-shape assertion is the only kind that can see the difference between
 * omitting a key and normalizing it to empty.

 *
 * - `exactOnly` now gates a matching stage, so `Boolean(params.exactOnly)`
 *   turned the string `"false"` — a common shape for an LLM caller emitting
 *   JSON — into `true` and persisted a registry with the wildcard stage
 *   suppressed. The opposite of what the caller asked for, written to disk.
 * - `skipEmbeddings` and `allowStale` were retired. The CLI rejects them
 *   outright; the MCP path accepted and silently dropped them, so an agent
 *   working from a cached schema was told nothing.
 *
 * Every case asserts `syncGroupMock` was NOT called: a rejection that still
 * runs the sync is the failure mode, and an error string alone cannot tell
 * the two apart.
