/**
 * `writeBridge` replaces `bridge.lbug` and writes `meta.json` as two separate
 * operations, so there is a window between them that an interrupted or failing
 * sync stops inside. Which way that window fails is a correctness decision, not
 * a detail.
 *
 * `meta.json` records which repos the sync could not account for, and since
 * #3011 `runGroupImpact` folds that into its truncation fields. So a STALE meta
 * left beside a NEWLY swapped bridge asserts that the new bridge is as complete
 * as the previous sync was — a confident wrong answer about the exact thing this
 * channel exists to make legible.
 *
 * Deleting the old meta before the swap would close that, and is wrong. The
 * rename of the old database is wrapped in a catch that also swallows a FAILED
 * rename — a held read-only handle does this on Windows — so `writeBridge` can
 * throw with the old, perfectly good database still in place. Its metadata would
 * then be gone unrecoverably, and cross-repo impact would answer "we cannot say"
 * for as long as the swap kept failing. That is a working feature destroyed to
 * close a narrow window.
 *
 * So nothing is deleted. `writeBridge` stamps the database's size and mtime into
 * the metadata, and `bridgeMetaMatchesFile` checks the pair still belongs
 * together. This file pins both halves: a stale meta is rejected, and a sync
 * that fails leaves the previous, matching pair intact.
 */

/**
 * `mode` selects which rename fails, and the distinction matters:
 *
 *  - `'all'` models the Windows shape the fix is really about. The old
 *    database's move to `.bak` is itself wrapped in a catch that swallows
 *    failures, so a held read-only handle makes that move fail SILENTLY and the
 *    subsequent `tmp -> bridge.lbug` throw — leaving the old database exactly
 *    where it was, still valid.
 *  - `'final'` fails only the `tmp -> bridge.lbug` step, so the old database has
 *    already been moved aside to `.bak` and no database is in place at all.
