/**
 * A bridge built by a sync that could not account for every configured repo is
 * MISSING crossings, not free of them. Those repos' contracts — and every
 * cross-link touching them — never made it into `bridge.lbug`, and nothing in
 * the impact walk can notice: the only incompleteness channel on a
 * `GroupImpactResult` is `truncationFields(...)`, and that is driven purely by
 * fan-out state.
 *
 * The failure this file pins: `group impact` on a symbol whose one downstream
 * consumer lives in an unreadable repo returned `{ cross: [], truncated: false }`
 * — "complete: nothing depends on this". That is a wrong answer, not an empty
 * one, for the tool an agent uses to license a delete or a rename.
 *
 * `readBridgeMeta` is deliberately NOT stubbed here: the `meta.json` each case
 * writes is the input under test, so it has to travel the real read.
