/**
 * The staged contracts must be appended by a BOUNDED construct.
 *
 * Staging (above) is what made the append dangerous. Before it, each extractor's
 * output was appended as it came back, so `autoContracts.push(...)` only ever
 * spread one extractor's contracts; staging makes it spread the whole repo's.
 * A spread call passes every element as a separate ARGUMENT, and the engine caps
 * how many arguments a call can take — so a repo that stages enough contracts
 * kills the sync with `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` on the one
 * line whose job is to commit the work that just succeeded.
 *
 * This gate is structural rather than size-based ON PURPOSE. The argument limit
 * is a function of the host's available stack: this machine accepts a 125k-element
 * spread and dies at 150k, and a larger-stack host sails past both. A "make the
 * fixture big enough to crash" test therefore passes against unfixed code on some
 * hosts — which is precisely the guarantee a regression gate cannot give up. The
 * size test below is a completeness/ordering check, not the guard.
 *
 * Scope: the per-repo extractor `try` block ONLY. `sync.ts` also spreads in the
 * windowed manifest loop (`autoContracts.push(...windowResult.contracts)` and its
 * cross-link twin). Those predate this change, are bounded by the window size,
 * and are not what this gate is about — a text scan keyed on `autoContracts.push(...`
 * would match them too and fail on code this change never touches. So the region
 * is located by AST and by ROLE, not by name: the `const … : StoredContract[] = []`
 * staging buffer declared per repo (the function-scoped `let autoContracts` is
 * excluded by the `const`), then the one `try` whose block references it. Renaming
 * either identifier keeps the gate pointed at the same code.
 *
 * `.apply(` is rejected alongside the spread: `push.apply(dest, staged)` is the
 * same argument-limit hazard wearing different syntax.
