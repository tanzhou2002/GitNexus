/**
 * `RELATION_SCHEMA` is generated from two cross products plus one hand-written
 * block. This file guards the generated half; a pair drawn from either rule and
 * absent from the DDL does not degrade — `assertDeclaredPair` throws and
 * `analyze` dies mid-phase on whichever codebase first produces it. Failing
 * here means fixing the rule, not the assertion.
 *
 * WHAT SCHEMA.TS NO LONGER RISKS. The DDL used to carry hand-copied twins of
 * `LINKABLE_LABELS` / `CALL_TARGET_TYPES`. Those are deleted — schema.ts now
 * imports the originals — so two whole failure modes are structurally
 * impossible rather than merely asserted: a label present only in the twin, and
 * a label removed from the original while the DDL keeps its pairs. Neither was
 * catchable before (a twin-only `Class|Record` left every assertion green).
 *
 * WHAT STILL NEEDS ASSERTING, and is:
 *  - the rules themselves — the constants below are a deliberate PIN of
 *    schema.ts's two rules, recomputed here from `LINKABLE_LABELS`,
 *    `CALL_TARGET_TYPES` and `NODE_TABLES`. Widening a rule in schema.ts alone
 *    fails `generated region matches …`, so the widening has to be stated
 *    twice, on purpose.
 *  - the generated region for EXACT equality, not containment — so a pair
 *    hand-added to the generated half (the reflex that produced #2781, #2792
 *    and #2793) fails just as loudly as a missing one.
 *  - `STRUCTURAL_PAIR_DDL` carrying nothing a rule already generates. Every
 *    other assertion here subtracts `structural` from BOTH sides, so a
 *    redundant hand-declaration was invisible to all of them; `no hand-declared
 *    pair …` below is the one that sees it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT SEE: a pair hand-added to {@link STRUCTURAL_PAIR_DDL}
 * that NEITHER rule covers — the ~69 containment/inheritance/import pairs
 * between two definition labels. That surface has no predicate, so it is
 * bounded by a corpus instead, in
 * `test/integration/structural-pair-coverage.test.ts`.
