// Regression guard for #2899. The `risk: UNKNOWN` Always-Do bullet and its
// Never-Do clause describe `impact`'s risk semantics, which are not
// PDG-dependent — unlike the `pdg_query` bullet (gated on `hasPdg`, see
// ai-context.test.ts's "gates the pdg_query line on hasPdg" test), these two
// must render in the generated <!-- gitnexus:start --> block regardless of
// hasPdg.
//
// They were previously hand-added INSIDE the machine-managed block of the
// committed AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md instead of living in this template, so every
// real `gitnexus analyze` run silently deleted them on regeneration — twice
// (#2856's 8f8261021, then #2899's own 9e602aef0, which piggybacked an
// unrelated fetch-parsing fix and also regressed the checked-in index stats
// 248612/565510/918 -> 42853/135955/758, itself evidence the docs had been
// regenerated from a stale local index rather than hand-edited). Moving the
// two lines into generateGitNexusContent (src/cli/ai-context.ts) is the
// actual fix; this test is what keeps them there. A second, independent
// guard reads the committed AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md docs directly — see
// "root AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md managed block keeps the risk: UNKNOWN policy
// (#2899)" in shipped-skills-sync.test.ts — so a hand-revert or a stale
// generator binary is caught even if this template-level test somehow isn't.
