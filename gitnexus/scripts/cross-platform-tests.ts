/**
 * Cross-platform test subset runner.
 *
 * Runs only the tests that exercise platform-sensitive behavior on
 * Windows and macOS. The full suite runs on Ubuntu; this narrows the
 * cross-platform matrix to tests that actually vary across OSes.
 *
 * Categories included:
 *   - Platform-specific logic (path.sep, process.platform guards)
 *   - Native addon loading (LadybugDB, tree-sitter)
 *   - Process spawning and shell behavior
 *   - Filesystem locking and temp-dir behavior
 *   - Worker threads (real, not mocked)
 *   - CLI end-to-end tests
 *
 * When adding a new test that uses platform-varying APIs (native addons,
 * child_process with real spawning, filesystem locking, path.sep), add
 * it to the appropriate section below.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx vitest run $(npx tsx scripts/cross-platform-tests.ts)
 *   # or via the package script:
 *   npm run test:cross-platform
