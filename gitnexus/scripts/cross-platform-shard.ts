/**
 * Weight-aware partitioning for the cross-platform test matrix.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `run-cross-platform.ts` used to hand vitest the whole file
 * list plus `--shard=i/n`, and vitest partitions by file COUNT. Runtime on this
 * suite is wildly uneven — measured on the Windows runner, `cli-e2e` is 621 s
 * and `worker-pool` 221 s, while most files are under a second — so a
 * count-split routinely put several of the heaviest suites on one shard. That
 * is #2449, and this file's sibling header has documented the symptom ("the
 * heaviest spawn suites can cluster on one shard") since the watchdog was first
 * raised from 15 to 20 minutes.
 *
 * It went from a latent hazard to a red matrix when three CHEAP files (the
 * `dist/` module-load closure guards: 448 ms, 53 ms, sub-second) were added to
 * `SPAWN_CLI`. They cost nothing to run, but a count-split re-partitions on
 * every insertion, and the reshuffle happened to land `cli-e2e` + `cli-limit-e2e`
 * + `analyze-heap-oom-e2e` together on shard 1/3 — 32 files against 26 and 29 —
 * which blew the 20-minute budget with four files still queued. Nothing about
 * the added files caused it; they were simply the perturbation.
 *
 * So the split is done HERE, by weight, and only the chosen shard's files are
 * handed to vitest. Two properties follow, and both are pinned in
 * `test/unit/cross-platform-shard.test.ts`:
 *
 *  - the heaviest suites are spread across shards by construction, so the
 *    busiest shard tracks the ideal rather than the luck of the sort order;
 *  - adding or removing a CHEAP file cannot move a heavy one, so registering a
 *    new platform-sensitive test is no longer a CI-stability gamble. That is the
 *    property whose absence caused this.
 */

/**
 * Measured wall-clock on the WINDOWS runner (the slowest platform, so it is the
 * one that decides the budget), in seconds, from the last fully-green matrix run
 * plus the timed files of the run that failed.
 *
 * Only files heavy enough to matter are listed; everything else is carried by
 * {@link PER_FILE_OVERHEAD_SEC} alone. These are load-balancing hints, NOT
 * assertions — no test measures elapsed time against this table. Missing or
 * stale heavy entries can still overload a shard; refresh them from failed
 * CI logs and replay that profile in the partition tests. Deliberately not
 * auto-generated: a committed table is reviewable and works offline, and the
 * alternative (timing files at CI runtime to decide the split) would make the
 * partition depend on the very machine load it is trying to protect against.

 * unattributed setup. Without this term the balancer treats a light file as
