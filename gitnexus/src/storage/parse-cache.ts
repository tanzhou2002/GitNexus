/**
 * Chunk-level content-addressed parse cache.
 *
 * The pipeline always parses every file (correctness invariant: cross-file
 * resolution and downstream phases need full graph data). What this cache
 * does is skip the tree-sitter worker dispatch when a chunk's contents
 * haven't changed since the last run.
 *
 * Granularity: chunk-level. Files are assigned to a stable
 * `(language, hash(path) mod 128)` bucket, then packed to a 2 MiB (or
 * operator) byte budget *inside* that bucket. Membership does not depend
 * on worker count. The cache key is `sha256(joined(filePath:contentHash
 * for each file in the chunk, sorted))`. A content edit invalidates only
 * that file's pack; add/delete/rename only the affected bucket.
 *
 * Why not per-file:
 * - Workers process sub-batches and emit aggregated `ParseWorkerResult`s.
 *   Splitting back to per-file would require reworking the worker contract.
 * - Chunk-level invalidation gives a useful speedup floor (98% on a single
 *   1-of-50 invalidated chunk) without touching the worker.
 *
 * `--force` still reuses content-addressed shards (it only rebuilds graph/FTS).
 * `useParseCache: false` reparses every file, writes a staging generation, and
 * publishes onto this cache only after a successful analysis.

// Bumped to 4 in #1983: on-disk parse-cache shards omit legacy DAG fields
// (`calls`, `assignments`, `constructorBindings`) unused after RING4-1 (#942)
// and the worker `parsedFiles` (the worker writes those to the disk ParsedFile
// store instead). #2038 added a DURABLE, content-addressed ParsedFile store
// (`parsedfile-cache/`, see parsedfile-store.ts) keyed by chunk hash that
// mirrors THIS cache's lifecycle — version-gated by PARSE_CACHE_VERSION, pruned
// in lockstep to the surviving keys. On a warm parse-cache hit the chunk's
// ParsedFiles are restored from it, so scope-resolution does NOT re-extract on
// the main thread (the #1983 OOM). Because the two stores share this version,
// any future change to the `ParsedFile` serialization shape MUST bump
// SCHEMA_BUMP so both invalidate in lockstep.
// v35: Java/Kotlin Spring @Bean factory and @Resource side-channel facts
// (#2413). ParsedFile results are content-addressed and replayed verbatim, so
// the feature/schema inventory alone cannot invalidate pre-#2413 captures.
// (Cut as v32 on this branch; `main` took 32 for #2742 and 33/34 for #2747
// first, so this series is renumbered at merge time — see the v21 note.)
// v34: the receiver-chain capture is emitted by ALL 14 language emitters, not
// just TypeScript. v33 landed with the TypeScript-only emission; the rollout to
// the other 13 languages changed the capture set AGAIN, so a cache stamped 33 by
// an intermediate build of that series is not equivalent to one stamped at this
// commit — it would be treated as current while every non-TypeScript file
// replayed pre-rollout captures, leaving the feature silently inert for 13 of 14
// languages. Bumped there so the version tracks the FINAL capture set rather
// than the first divergence.
// v33: TypeScript call matches carry `@reference.receiver-chain`, a compact
// encoding of a receiver that is itself an expression.
// v32: Rust items are qualified by their enclosing `mod` chain (#2742). The
// qualified name is computed in the parse worker, so a warm cache replays the
// old unqualified ids verbatim and the collapse persists.
// v31: Rust `mod_item` gained `@declaration.namespace` and scoped call sites
// gained `@reference.qualified-name` (#2730). Both are PARSE-TIME captures, so a
// warm cache replays the old capture set verbatim: `rawQualifiedName` comes back
// undefined and no Namespace def exists to hang a module prefix on, which turns
// the whole module-qualified resolution tier into a no-op on unchanged files.
// Re-checked against origin/main at commit time per the v29 note below.
// v29: closure-binding declaration rules for PHP/Rust/Kotlin/Ruby/Dart, a Rust
// graph node for `let f = || …`, a Dart closure scope, and function-local VALUES
// (Variable/Const/Property/Static) qualified by their enclosing callable plus
// position (#2699 parts A1 + B). All parse-time, so a warm cache would replay
// the old captures and the pre-qualification ids verbatim.
//
// This is 29 and not 28 because of the exact collision the v21 note below warns
// about: this branch cut at 27 and bumped to 28, while #2415 bumped 27 -> 28 and
// merged FIRST. Re-checking against origin/main at merge time — not at branch
// time — is what caught it; leaving it at 28 would have shipped this change with
// NO parse-cache invalidation, so every warm cache keeps serving the pre-fix
// captures and ids.
// v28: Java/Kotlin capture side-channels persist Spring condition facts and
// annotation-source line numbers (#2415).
// v26: the enclosing-callable walk stops at class bodies and anonymous-class
// construction sites (#2699 follow-up); a v25 cache replays worker results carrying the
// wrong Java anonymous-class ids. Cached results are replayed verbatim — including
// across `--force` — so without this bump a warm cache keeps serving them.
// v25: function-local callables are qualified by their enclosing-callable chain
// plus their own position, and JS/TS gain block scopes (#2699). Both the node
// ids AND the scope tree in a cached worker result are therefore stale. Cached
// results are replayed verbatim — including across `--force` — so without this
// bump a warm cache keeps serving the colliding ids and the block-less scopes.
// v24: function scopes carry `Scope.ownsReceivers`, marking the JS/TS forms
// that bind their own `this` (#2701). The flag lives on the cached `Scope`, so
// without this bump a warm cache replays scopes that lack it and every `this`
// inside an ordinary `function` keeps resolving to the enclosing class —
// verified by probe: `--force` alone does NOT re-derive it.
// v23: closure bindings emit callable nodes in Dart, Ruby, Java, C# and PHP
// (plus JS/TS `var`), and Dart/PHP gain the scope declarations and flow
// captures their forms were missing (#2693). Cached worker results are replayed
// verbatim, so without this bump a warm cache keeps serving the old labels.
// v22: `const X = <arrow | function-expression>` emits one `Function` node
// instead of a `Function` plus an edgeless `Const` twin (#2687). Cached worker
// results are replayed verbatim — including across `--force` — so without this
// bump a warm cache keeps serving the old two-node set.
// v21: TWO changes share this number — a collision, not a typo. #2632
// (Java/Kotlin Spring DI facts: constructor, field/property and method
// injection sites plus bean-name and @Primary provider metadata) bumped 20 -> 21
// and merged first; #2653 (Java local class/enum/record/interface captures using
// javac-compatible, source-type-relative JLS 13.1 identities and
// declaration-to-block scopes, #2562) had branched at 20, bumped to 21 as well,
// and merged second — so it shipped with NO invalidation of its own. An index
// already stamped 21 by the first change was treated as current by the second
// and kept serving stale local-class identities from the warm cache. Harmless
// now (anything below the current value is rejected), and left as-is because
// both genuinely shipped as 21 — renumbering would misstate history. Read this
// as the reason to re-check SCHEMA_BUMP against origin/main immediately before
// merging, not just when the branch is cut; the same collision hit
// the DB schema version in #2653/#2654 (that constant is gone — the DB side is
// a derived fingerprint now, see SCHEMA_FINGERPRINT; SCHEMA_BUMP below is still
// hand-maintained because no declarative artifact describes a capture set).
// v27: generator EXPRESSIONS bound to a name emit a callable definition capture,
// and nested-callable caller attribution appends the localIdentity suffix the
// definition phase already used. Both are parse-time, so a warm cache would
// otherwise replay the old captures and ids verbatim.
// v30/schema v22: CommonJS export capture emission (#2723) — new @definition/@declaration
// captures for exports.X, aliased receivers, module-level `this`, re-export
// forwarding and `module.exports = fn`, plus prototype/`this` Methods. A warm
// cache would otherwise replay the pre-fix captures verbatim.
// v20: Java/Kotlin capture side-channels persist package and class-annotation
// facts for shared Spring Bean resolution.
// v19: Java enum constant bodies emit E$N Class nodes; anonymous naming uses
// JLS 13.1 immediate-host chains (#2555).
// v18: Worker$N anonymous bodies. v17: callable-value-flow operand identity.
// v16: direct callee identity.
// v36: bound-callable graph `startLine` follows the initializer so multi-line
// closure bindings join the scope channel (#2735). Warm cache would otherwise
// keep serving wrapper-line startLines and drop the CALLS edge.
// v37: Java/Kotlin capture side-channels include Spring AOP owner/advice facts
// (#2416). Warm cache entries at v36 do not carry those facts and would silently
// omit ADVISED_BY evidence.
// v38: Swift nested conditional-compilation directives are blanked before the
// parse (#2771), so a class body that previously error-recovered away now
// survives. The chunk key hashes raw on-disk bytes and `preprocessSource` runs
// after it is computed, so unchanged Swift files would otherwise replay their
// pre-fix `ParseWorkerResult` verbatim — including across `--force`. Allocated
// on `main`, NOT by this branch — kept so the number is not reused a third time.
// v39: receiver-chain wire format v2 — the encoded chain gained name-free
// `await` and `index` step kinds, so the VERSION prefix moved 1 -> 2 and every
// persisted chain string changed. A v2 decoder REFUSES a v1 payload (that is
// the point: a chain missing its await or index hop decodes cleanly as a
// different, shorter chain and would type the receiver against the wrong
// member), so a stale cache replays chains this build silently discards —
// the feature degrades to the text cascade with no error anywhere. Bumped so
// the stale cache is rejected rather than half-read.
//
// NUMBERED 39, AFTER TWO REALLOCATIONS. This branch first used 37; `main` took
// 37 for Spring AOP (#2416) mid-flight, so it moved to 38; `main` then took 38
// for the Swift directive fix (#2771), landing on the branch's number AGAIN.
// That is the EIGHTH collision in this series and the SECOND exact clash — two
// incompatible schemas claiming one number, twice running. The lesson is not
// "pick a bigger number": it is that the check must happen immediately before
// merge, because the window between review and merge is exactly when `main`
// allocates. Re-check against origin/main before merging this.
// v40: inference-typed class fields emit type-binding captures in SIX languages
// (#2807) — TypeScript/JavaScript `public_field_definition|field_definition` with a
// `new_expression` value and `this.<field> = new X()`; Python `self.x = Outer()`;
// Ruby `@ivar = Foo.new`; Swift optional property annotations; Dart inferred-type
// and final field declarations plus constructor-body field writes. Every one of
// these is PARSE-TIME capture emission, so a warm cache replays the pre-fix
// capture set verbatim for byte-unchanged files and the new receiver edges never
// appear — silently, with no error, exactly the v27/v30 failure mode. `analyze`
// skips tree-sitter dispatch for unchanged chunks (GUARDRAILS.md), so a plain
// re-analyze does NOT surface them without this bump.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING — main was also at 39
// when this was allocated, and this file records eight prior collisions.
// v41: the v40 Dart field-write binding gained its READ-side mask (#2807 review)
// — a Dart class-member body that rebinds one of its class's field names now
// emits `@receiver-owner.shadowed-fields` on its synthesized `@scope.function`
// match, which becomes `Scope.ownsReceivers`. Parse-time capture emission again,
// so a v40 warm cache replays scope matches with no marker and the receiver walk
// still reaches the class field — i.e. it keeps serving the WRONG edge this
// bump's fix removes, silently. Same bump-or-nothing situation as v40.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// v42: the v40/v41 Python constructor-field arm stopped accepting a DOTTED
// callee (#2807 review). `self.svc = f.Alpha()` no longer emits a
// `@type-binding.constructor` capture at all, which is what removes the
// fabricated edge to the same-named class `Alpha` and what stops
// `self.conn = Registry.get()` displacing an earlier real `self.conn = Outer()`.
// A within-PR re-bump, not a collision fix: v41 was allocated by this same
// unmerged branch, so v41-stamped caches exist only on it — but they exist on
// every reviewer's and CI runner's checkout of it, and parse-time emission means
// they replay the pre-fix capture set for byte-unchanged files and keep serving
// the fabricated edge. main is at 39, so 40/41/42 are all this branch's.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// v43: Go embedded fields now emit `@reference.embedded-pointer` when written
// as `*T` rather than `T` (#2813 exact method sets). Go's method-set rules make
// the two forms genuinely different — `struct{ Base }` does NOT get Base's
// pointer-receiver methods in its value method set while `struct{ *Base }` does
// — so structural interface satisfaction cannot be exact without the spelling.
// This is PARSE-TIME capture emission, so a warm cache replays the pre-fix
// capture set for byte-unchanged files and the distinction never appears:
// silently, with no error, the v27/v30 failure mode. `analyze` skips tree-sitter
// dispatch for unchanged chunks (GUARDRAILS.md), so a plain re-analyze does NOT
// surface it without this bump.
//
// 42 -> 43: this branch originally allocated 43 while sitting at 39, because
// main had already taken 40/41/42 for #2807. main has since merged those and
// this branch rebased onto it, so 43 remains the next free number and the
// value is unchanged by the rebase — the reason it was chosen is simply now
// visible in the history above. RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY
// BEFORE MERGING; this file records eight prior collisions, two EXACT.
// Moved 43 -> 44 for #2842's TypeScript heritage capture, which now emits
// `@reference.inherits` for `interface_declaration` and
// `abstract_class_declaration`. That is PARSE-TIME emission, so a v43 warm
// cache would serve entries that are missing those matches entirely — the
// exact failure a bump exists to prevent. Verified against origin/main at
// a857f4c5a, which is still on 43, so 44 is free. RE-CHECK BEFORE MERGE.

// 44 -> 45: #2837 re-anchors Go's struct/interface captures from the
// `type_declaration` onto the `type_spec` (`languages/go/query.ts`
// @scope.class/@declaration.struct/@declaration.interface, and GO_QUERIES
// @definition.struct/@definition.interface in `tree-sitter-queries.ts`). Every
// Go file declaring a type therefore emits DIFFERENT capture ranges — measured:
// 70 fixture digests moved with zero change in capture COUNT — and a grouped
// `type (...)` block emits nodes it previously did not emit at all. Parse-time,
// so a warm cache would replay pre-fix ParsedFiles and the fix would be a silent
// no-op on every incremental analyze while still passing every cold-run test.
//
// This branch originally took 44 and it COLLIDED: #2842 above merged first and
// claimed it. The ninth entry in this ledger, and the third EXACT clash. Worth
// recording HOW it was caught, because the pin test cannot catch it — both PRs
// asserted `toBe(44)`, which passes even when main is already 44, so the two
// capture schemas would have shared one PARSE_CACHE_VERSION and the durable
// ParsedFile store would have replayed pre-fix ParsedFiles verbatim for one of
// them. Only comparing against origin/main at MERGE time surfaces it.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// 45 -> 46 for the JavaScript bare-identifier read captures (A2), which emit
// `@reference.read.identifier` in value positions (call arguments,
// default-parameter values, return statements) so a module-scope `const` read
// only by bare name finally mints a reference site, plus the object-literal
// `@definition.property` rule and the TypeScript shape-member captures. All
// PARSE-TIME emission, so a warm cache serves entries carrying none of those
// matches and the new nodes and edges never appear — observed directly while
// developing: a full `analyze --force` produced a byte-identical graph and read
// as a failed hypothesis until the cache was cleared by hand.
//
// This branch originally took 45 and it COLLIDED: #2837 above merged first and
// claimed it. The TENTH entry in this ledger and the FOURTH exact clash, caught
// exactly as the note above says it must be — by comparing against origin/main
// at merge time, not at review time. The pin test cannot catch it: both sides
// asserted `toBe(45)`, which passes while main is already 45, so two capture
// schemas would have shared one PARSE_CACHE_VERSION and the durable ParsedFile
// store would have replayed pre-fix ParsedFiles verbatim for one of them.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
//
// 46 -> 47: method-level Spring `@RequestMapping` now emits wildcard routes
// and one route per static `RequestMethod.X` value. These decorator routes live
// in ParseWorkerResult and are replayed verbatim on warm cache hits, so keeping
// the previous version would make the fix a no-op for every unchanged Java file.
// PR #2856 claims 46, so this branch owns 47. Verified against upstream/main at
// 021ac3037 (still 45). RE-CHECK BEFORE MERGE.
//
// ── The FIFTH clash, and the first one the ledger's own convention prevented ──
// #2857 above merged while this branch sat waiting, and it did the right thing:
// it read this PR's claim on 46 and took 47 instead of colliding. That left the
// clash one step further up — 46 was safe, but THIS branch's own 47 (below) was
// not, and neither was anything after it. Every entry from here down has been
// renumbered +1 at merge time. Nothing about the capture sets changed; only the
// numbers did, which is the whole point of re-checking at merge rather than at
// review. Ledger entries 11 through 15.
//
// SIXTH clash, same shape, one merge later: #2833 then took 48 for a generic-
// receiver fix, so this branch's chain shifted +1 AGAIN and now runs 49-53.
// The capture sets have never moved; only the numbers have. This is the cost of
// a single global counter with concurrent PRs, and #2860 is the mechanical fix.
//
// 48 -> 49 for the round-2 capture work: object literals behind an
// identity-preserving wrapper (`const X = Object.freeze({ ... })`) now mint
// `@definition.property` for their keys. Parse-time like every entry above, and
// this one was ALSO observed as a false negative first: `analyze --force`
// against a fixture carrying the new shape returned the pre-change node set and
// read as "the query does not match", until the on-disk cache was removed by
// hand and the same run produced the node. `--force` re-runs the pipeline but
// still serves ParsedFiles from the durable store, so it does not substitute
// for this bump.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
//
// 49 -> 50 for the TypeScript object-literal captures (R3-3): named
// object-literal keys and the identity-wrapper form now mint `@definition.property`
// in TYPESCRIPT_QUERIES, as they already did for JavaScript. Parse-time, so a
// warm cache would replay ParsedFiles carrying none of those matches and the
// keys would stay invisible.
//
// #2860 adds a CI check comparing this against the base branch — the merge-time
// re-check this ledger has asked for by hand across ten entries and four exact
// clashes. It is NOT on this branch, so until that one merges the re-check
// below is still manual.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// 50 -> 51 for the return-shape and shorthand captures (R3-4): keys of an
// anonymous literal in return position, and shorthand keys in both that and the
// variable-bound form. Parse-time again.
//
// The v34 hazard, and this branch has already tripped it: a build stamped 48
// (now 50) was installed and used to analyze two repos BEFORE these captures
// existed, so caches stamped 48 exist that carry none of them. Within one PR the version
// only has to differ from main's, but an INTERMEDIATE build of the same series
// is a different capture set wearing the same number — which is exactly what
// the note above records for 33/34.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// 51 -> 52 is NOT needed for R3-5: that pass is scope-resolution, not
// parse-time capture, so a warm cache replays ParsedFiles that already carry
// everything it reads. Recorded because the reflex on this branch has been to
// bump, and a bump nobody needs still forces every user a full re-parse.
//
// 51 -> 52 IS needed for dispatch-guard routes (R3-7): the JS/TS providers now
// implement `extractDecoratorRoutes`, and decorator routes are worker output
// carried in the parse cache. A warm cache replays a worker result whose
// `decoratorRoutes` predates the extractor entirely, so every hand-rolled route
// stays invisible and `route_map` keeps answering empty — the exact symptom the
// change exists to fix, wearing the mask of "the extractor does not work".
//
// 52 -> 53 for the same-file constant folding that followed it. The v34 hazard
// again, and this branch has now tripped it TWICE: a build stamped 50 (now 52)
// was used to analyze before folding existed, so those caches carry the unfolded
// route set. Caught by measuring — the post-folding run came back suspiciously
// fast and would have reported the pre-folding number, which is precisely how
// "an intermediate build of the same series is a different capture set wearing
// the same number" shows up in practice. Within one PR the version only has to
// differ from main's; against a cache YOU wrote, it has to differ from itself.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
//

// 47 -> 48: #2833 makes a generic-typed FIELD usable as a call receiver. Three
// parse-time changes ride on this one value:
//   - C++ (`languages/cpp/query.ts`) gains `field_declaration` rules whose
//     `type:` is a `template_type` or a `qualified_identifier` wrapping one.
//     The rules that existed all required a bare `type_identifier`, so
//     `Repo<User> repo;` and `std::vector<Item> items;` matched NONE of them and
//     the member got no type binding at all — new captures where there were none.
//   - Python (`languages/python/interpret.ts`) reduces a subscripted type its
//     container allow-lists do not claim to its base name, so `Repo[User]` binds
//     as `Repo`. That rewrites `TypeRef.rawName`, which is serialized into the
//     cached ParsedFile.
//   - `SymbolDefinition.typeParameters` — the DECLARED parameter list
//     (`template <class T>`, `class Box<T extends Repo>`), captured nowhere
//     before and on a different axis from the existing `templateArguments`. Six
//     per-language declaration queries gained `@declaration.type-parameters` and
//     `scope-extractor.ts` reads it onto every class-like def.
// A warm cache would replay the pre-fix ParsedFiles, so every file served from
// it would carry the old captures while passing every cold-run test — the exact
// failure this constant exists to prevent.
//
// WHAT THE BUMP DOES NOT COVER. It invalidates the PARSE half only. Whether the
// re-parsed captures reach the graph is a separate gate: `isIncremental`
// (`core/run-analyze.ts`) tests `!options.force`, an existing meta,
// `!schemaFingerprintMismatch(...)`, feature parity, non-empty `fileHashes` and
// a git repo — SCHEMA_BUMP appears in none of them — and an incremental run then
// writes back only `hashDiff.toWrite`, logging the rest as "unchanged file rows
// preserved". SCHEMA_FINGERPRINT is a hash of node/relation DDL, which this
// branch does not touch, so it is byte-identical and moves nothing either.
// Net: after this bump an incremental analyze re-parses an unchanged file
// correctly but keeps its existing rows, and the new edges land on the next full
// rebuild (`--force`, or any run whose runner identity or DDL moved). That is
// the pre-existing contract for every capture change, not a regression here.
//
// THIS BRANCH COLLIDED TWICE, which is why it lands on 48 rather than 46.
// It first took 46 (the C++/Python captures) and then 47 (typeParameters), both
// verified free against origin/main at 021ac3037. By merge time main had moved:
// #2856 claims 46 and #2857 took 47 and merged first. The eleventh entry in this
// ledger and the FOURTH and FIFTH exact clashes — and note what caught them.
// Not the pin test: this branch asserted `toBe(47)` and so did #2857, and both
// pass, because a literal pin cannot see the other side. Only diffing
// origin/main at the moment of merge surfaces it. Every value this branch
// published (46, 47) is superseded by 48, so a warm cache stamped with either is
// correctly invalidated.
//
// 53 -> 54 for W2-8: `@declaration.type-parameters` is now captured on generic
// FUNCTIONS, generator functions and type ALIASES in TYPESCRIPT_SCOPE_QUERY, not
// only on class/interface declarations. Parse-time emission, so a warm cache
// replays ParsedFiles whose defs carry no parameter list and the shadowing guard
// that consumes it silently does nothing — the feature would look implemented
// and be inert, which is the failure this constant exists to prevent.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// 54 -> 55 for W2-9: the dispatch-guard verb walk now tracks boolean POLARITY,
// so `(req.method === 'GET' ? false : true) && pathname === '/x'` no longer
// reports GET — the one method that branch guarantees the request does not have
// — and `!!(req.method === 'GET')` no longer loses its verb. Routes are emitted
// at parse time and replayed verbatim from a warm cache, so without this bump an
// already-indexed repo keeps serving the inverted verb and the fix looks inert.
// Same reason 51 and 52 were taken for R3-7.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// 55 -> 56 for R3-8 (part 1): a dispatch guard's verb walk now returns ALL the
// methods a guard serves, so `(req.method === 'GET' || req.method === 'POST') &&
// pathname === '/x'` emits two routes instead of reporting GET alone, and a
// disjunction with a non-verb operand emits none instead of the first verb it
// saw. Routes are parse-time output replayed verbatim from a warm cache.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// 56 -> 57 for R3-8 (part 2): `pathname.match(RE)` is read as a route test
// alongside `RE.test(pathname)`, a bound match takes its verb from where the
// binding is TESTED rather than where it is bound, a regex named by a same-file
// const resolves, and `regexToRoutePath` accepts a CAPTURING segment wildcard
// (`([^/]+)`) — the form every real dispatcher writes and the one it refused.
// All parse-time route output, replayed verbatim from a warm cache.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// 57 -> 58 for #2897: the fetch capture no longer requires a LITERAL url, so a
// call passing a variable is recorded as an outward-action site. Measured, 44 of
// 47 fetch calls in this repo pass a variable, so the R3-6 sink signal was
// absent from 94% of them. Parse-time capture output replayed verbatim from a
// warm cache, so without the bump an indexed repo keeps its empty sink set and
// the fix looks inert.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// 58 -> 59 for the #2899 REVIEW FOLLOW-UP to the dispatch-guard route walk. Two
// route-output changes, both parse-time and both replayed verbatim from a warm
// cache, so without this bump an already-indexed repo keeps serving the wrong
// routes and both fixes look implemented while being inert:
//   (a) `matchBindings` / `tested` are keyed on (enclosing function, name)
//       instead of the bare identifier. A same-named non-match binding in
//       ANOTHER function used to mint a fabricated verbed route under the wrong
//       handler — reproduced: `DELETE /api/live/positions/{param1}/replay
//       handler=handleSettings` — which then EVICTED the true verb-less route
//       through `reconcileDispatchGuardRoutes`. `buildRegexConstantMap` refuses
//       a name rebound to a non-regex for the same reason.
//   (b) `verbsFromTernary` INTERSECTS the operands of a conjunction instead of
//       taking the first non-empty set. `(GET||POST) ? (POST||PUT) : false`
//       emitted GET and POST where only POST is reachable, and
//       `GET ? POST : false` emitted GET for an unsatisfiable guard.
// Both changes strictly REMOVE routes, so a stale cache serves strictly more
// wrong answers than a cold one — which is exactly the state this constant
// exists to make unreachable. Same reason 55, 56 and 57 were taken.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
//
// 59 -> 60 for #2864's `ParsedImport.reexportsName` plus the `@import.publishes`
// capture that gates it. The FIELD is the easy half to miss: it is not a
// capture, but `parsedfile-store.ts` serializes the whole ParsedFile
// generically, so a new optional property on `ParsedImport` is part of the
// cached shape all the same. Without the bump a warm cache replays pre-fix
// `ParsedImport`s carrying no flag, `isNamedReexport`'s strict `=== true` takes
// the old path, and the whole fix is a silent no-op on incremental analyze while
// every cold-run test passes — landing hardest on `__init__.py`, the
// rarest-changing and highest-cache-hit files in a Python repo. The MARKER makes
// it a capture change too, confirmed independently by
// `bench/python-scope/measure.mjs` drifting.
//
// This branch is the SIXTH exact clash, and the first one the re-check caught
// where the number did NOT have to move. It staged 60 while main was 53,
// deliberately clearing the two claims visible at the time (#2899 and #2891).
// #2899 then merged and cascaded main 53 -> 59 in five steps — far past the 54
// its diff appeared to claim, because reading a PR's LAST bump hunk understates a
// branch that bumps repeatedly. 60 survived only because it was chosen above the
// highest claim rather than at main + 1; had it been staged at 54 it would now be
// buried four deep inside main's own ledger. Take the next free value above every
// in-flight MAXIMUM, not above origin/main.
//
// Still open at this commit: #2891 also claims 59, which main now holds. That is
// a live exact clash for #2891 to renumber, not for this branch.
//
// 60 -> 62 for the two optional `ParsedImport` fields the cycle-checker fix
// adds: `typeOnly` (TS `import type`) and `runsOnlyWhenCalled` (an import
// written inside a function body). This is #2864's lesson arriving again, in
// the same shape and for the same reason — neither field is a capture, but
// `parsedfile-store.ts` serializes the whole ParsedFile generically, so both are
// part of the cached shape. Without the bump a warm cache replays pre-fix
// `ParsedImport`s carrying no flag, the strict `=== true` reads in
// `finalize-algorithm.ts` and `imports-to-edges.ts` take the untagged path, and
// `check --cycles` keeps reporting the erased and deferred imports this branch
// exists to stop reporting — a silent no-op on incremental analyze while every
// cold-run test in the branch passes. The failure is toward OVER-reporting, so
// it is loud rather than dangerous, but it is still the whole fix not applying.
// (`typeOnly` also has a capture half — `@import.type-only` from
// `typescript/import-decomposer.ts` — so that side would drift a capture bench;
// `runsOnlyWhenCalled` is decided in scope-extractor Pass 3 from the scope tree
// and has no marker at all, which is exactly the half that gets missed.)
//
// 63, not 62, and not 61: main holds 60, #2935 claims 61, and #2936 claims 62.
// Per the rule three paragraphs up, this is the next free value above every
// in-flight MAXIMUM, not above origin/main. #2891's 59 is already buried by main
// and is theirs to renumber; #1616's 2 is stale.
//
// This staged 62 first and was correct when written. #2936 opened four hours
// later and also took 62 — bumping for #2917's implicit Java record-component
// accessors, a genuinely different cached shape — because it re-checked against
// main (60) rather than against the in-flight claims, which is the SEVENTH exact
// clash and the same mistake the ledger above keeps recording. Moving rather
// than standing on seniority: 63 is above every claim, so it is correct whichever
// of the two merges first, and needs no coordination to stay correct. An exact
// clash is the dangerous shape precisely because neither side invalidates the
// other — a warm cache written by #2936's build would be read as valid by this
// one, and the accessor definitions it materializes are not in this branch's
// ParsedFile shape at all.
//
// 63 -> 64 for Java enum heritage plus annotated class, record, interface,
// enum, and explicit-super base names emitting corrected captures (#2918).
// Warm v63 ParsedFiles lack those captures and must be re-extracted.
// 64 -> 66 adds the synthetic-declaration sidecar used to keep anonymous class
// implementations from evicting ordinary implementors at the dispatch cap.
// That PR published a v64 head first, so 66 kept all the shapes in flight at the
// time distinct. (It also named a v65 claim from this branch; that claim was
// superseded before either landed — see the 66 -> 67 entry below. Nothing holds
// 65 now.)
//
// 66 -> 67 for #2917's implicit Java record-component accessor definitions and
// scope declarations. A warm cache would otherwise replay ParsedFiles without
// the synthesized accessors. This branch staged 65 before #2918's 66 landed on
// main; 67 is the next free value above every in-flight claim (main 66, #2939's
// 64), which is the ledger rule above — re-check against the claims, not just
// against main.
//
// 67 -> 68 for #2912's `ReferenceSite.typeArguments`: the generic arguments a
// heritage reference was written with (`: IValidator<string>`), derived at
// EXTRACTION time from the anchor's spelling. A warm cache replays `inherits`
// sites with the field absent, absence is the fail-open "unknown", and
// generic-instantiation filtering therefore degrades to the pre-fix fan-out on
// exactly the unchanged files — silent, and passing every cold-run test.
//
// This branch staged 64 when main held 60 and #2935/#2936/#2934 claimed 61/62/63.
// All three have since landed and cascaded main to 67, burying 64 inside main's
// own ledger — the EIGHTH time the re-check moved a number, and the reason the
// re-check is a merge step rather than a one-time choice. 68 is the next free
// value above every in-flight claim at this merge (main 67, #2891's 59, #1616's
// stale 2), which is the rule above: above every claim, not above origin/main.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
//
// 68 -> 69 added #2969's JS/TS data-route-table decoratorRoutes. A warm v68
// cache would replay unchanged worker results without those routes. Version 70
// then adds Spring non-HTTP handler side-channel facts (#2417 / #2891), so Java
// and Kotlin caches persist scheduled, event, messaging, and managed-job facts.
//
// 70 -> 71 adds the Java constant-route capture set (#2980):
// `route-extractors/java-const-resolver.ts`, the `spring.ts` operand branch,
// and the parse-worker's provider-driven constant harvest. A warm pre-feature
// cache replays those files' worker results with `moduleConstants` absent and
// `routePathOperands` unset, so every constant-based Spring route on an
// unchanged file is silently dropped — the feature is inert until something
// else invalidates the cache.
//
// This branch briefly reasoned that no bump was needed because the ledger
// "already sits at 70, whose capture set post-dates and includes this harvest".
// It does not: v70 was cut by fe3d7e56b for Spring non-HTTP handler facts
// (#2417 / #2891), an ancestor of this PR's base, and it cannot include a
// harvest that does not exist on main. Because
// `PARSE_CACHE_VERSION = ${SCHEMA_BUMP}+${GITNEXUS_PKG_VERSION}` and
// package.json is untouched here, leaving 70 makes the key BYTE-IDENTICAL
// before and after this merge — precisely the inert-feature trap the v33/v34
// notes above warn about. Exposure is bounded by the package version (a
// released upgrade invalidates anyway), but same-version warm caches — dev
// builds, CI caches, anyone who indexed with an unreleased build — replay the
// stale captures.
//
// 72, not 71: open PR #3017 (`fix/nest-decorator-routes`, NestJS decorator route
// indexing) already claims 71, with an identical pin test. Re-checking
// origin/main alone would not catch that — main is 70 and stays 70 until one of
// the two merges, at which point the second lands a byte-identical
// PARSE_CACHE_VERSION and is inert. This is exactly the rule the ledger states
// and the v37/v38 clash it was written for: the next free value above every
// IN-FLIGHT claim, not above origin/main. Every open PR touching gitnexus/ was
// scanned; #3017 is the only other claimant.
//
// 72 -> 74 adds import-proven Convex endpoint metadata to Const/Function worker
// output. A warm v72 cache has no convexEndpointFactory property, so the MCP
// impact probe would keep claiming exact results for unchanged endpoints. The
// parse-cache bump makes unchanged files re-parse; analyzer runner identity
// drift separately forces the graph re-emit (run-analyze.ts), and an id/schema
// migration needs both guarantees. Version 73 is intentionally skipped because
// concurrent PR #3046 (fixes #3041) claims it. Re-check main and open PRs
// immediately before merge.
//
// 74 -> 76 makes object-literal Function and Method members owner-qualified
// (#3041). A warm v74 cache replays the old collapsed callable ids and omits
// the new Const/Variable -> callable HAS_METHOD ownership edges, so this bump
// makes unchanged files re-parse rather than waiting for a source edit. The
// persisted graph is rebuilt separately when `analyzerRunnerIdentitiesEqual`
// detects the changed analyzer build in run-analyze.ts. Both guards are
// required; a parse-cache bump alone must never be read as a graph rebuild.
// Version 75 is intentionally skipped because concurrent PR #3017 claims it.
//
// 74 -> 75 adds #3009's NestJS decorator routes to the JS/TS decoratorRoutes
// channel. Same reasoning as 69: a warm pre-feature cache replays unchanged
// worker results, which for every already-indexed NestJS repo means replaying
// the empty route set this change exists to fix — the fix would appear to do
// nothing until something else invalidated the cache.
//
// 75, not 71 (this branch's original claim) and not 74: origin/main cascaded
// past both while this PR was open. #2980 took 71, #3046 claims 73, and the
// Convex endpoint-metadata change took 74 (skipping 73 for exactly that
// reason). 75 is the next free value above origin/main AND above every
// in-flight claim — the rule the ledger states, not "one above main". Every
// open PR touching gitnexus/src/storage/parse-cache.ts was scanned at this
// merge: #3046 (73) and #1616 (a stale 2) are the only other claimants.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main AND OPEN PRs IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
//
// 75 -> 76 for the NestJS multi-path (array) form: `@Get(['a','b'])` now yields
// one `decoratorRoutes` entry per path where it previously yielded none. That
// changes worker output for the same file, and 75 was already claimed earlier
// on this same branch — so a warm cache written by a dev or CI build at v75,
// before the array form landed, would replay the pre-feature captures under a
// BYTE-IDENTICAL `PARSE_CACHE_VERSION` and the array form would be inert. The
// package version is untouched here, so it cannot rescue that case. Same-branch
// re-bumping is unusual, but the ledger's rule is about what a warm cache can
// replay, not about how the value was reached.
//
// 76 -> 77 because 76 was NOT free. While this branch sat in review, origin/main
// advanced to ac68f5254 and #3046 took 76 — the value this branch already held.
// `gitnexus/package.json` is 1.6.9 on both sides, so `PARSE_CACHE_VERSION` was
// the byte-identical string `76+1.6.9` on two branches that changed
// incompatible worker output. Every warm cache would have been reused across
// both features, making both inert while every test stayed green.
//
// The sharpest part: #3046 skipped 75 BECAUSE this branch held it, then took
// 76 — and this branch had meanwhile moved 75 -> 76 for the array form. Two
// PRs each doing the bookkeeping correctly still collided, because each
// re-checked once and neither re-checked after the other moved. That is what
// the re-check line below is for, and why it says AT MERGE rather than
// when you pick the number.
//
// 78 was claimed concurrently by #3060 while this branch was in review. Both
// branches keep the same package version, so sharing 78 would replay
// incompatible worker output without a textual merge conflict. This branch
// therefore takes 79, the next free value above origin/main and every open PR
// found by the contents-API scan at their exact head SHAs.
//
// 79 -> 80 for #3088: parse-cache membership is `(language, sha256(path) mod
// 128)` then the byte budget *inside* that bucket. Worker count is no longer a
// membership input, so a warm v79 cache keyed sequential scan-order packs (and
// on multi-worker hosts, pool×2 MiB mega-chunks) must miss. Sidecar-era
// ParsedFile stores (#3086/#3087) share PARSE_CACHE_VERSION, so both stores
// invalidate in lockstep. origin/main at allocation is 79; open PRs that still
// touch gitnexus/src/storage/parse-cache.ts claim 78 (#3060), 71 (#2840), and
// 2 (#1616) — none claim 80. RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main AND OPEN PRs
// IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
//
// WHY THIS IS STILL A HAND-PICKED NUMBER, when `SCHEMA_FINGERPRINT` next door
// is a derived sha256 that cannot collide. The derivation exists and already
// runs: `resolveAnalyzerRunnerIdentity` computes `build.digest` over the
// analyzer build tree on every analyze. It is not used here because it moves on
// ANY build change — a comment-only edit, this paragraph included — so every
// dev and CI rebuild would force a full re-parse of every repo. That is the
// expensive half of the trade, and `PARSE_CACHE_VERSION` already carries the
// package version, so this counter's only job is separating builds that SHARE
// one: dev, CI, unreleased. Exactly the population a whole-build digest would
// punish, and exactly the population that hits the exact-clash failure.
//
// So the counter stays, and the open cost is that a bump nobody makes is
// invisible: a capture change with no bump ships inert and no check can see it.
// #2860 (a base-branch CI comparison) closes the "not greater than main" axis
// only. A digest over just the determinant subset — the language queries plus
// `route-extractors/` and `workers/` module content — would close the missing-
// bump axis without invalidating on unrelated churn, and is the real follow-up.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main AND OPEN PRs IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
//
// 80 -> 81: ParsedFile and parse-cache shards are one immutable `.v8` envelope
// each (no JSON/path/generation siblings). A v80 index still names `.json`
// keys and would skip workers while scope-resolution found nothing — the
// #1983 main-thread reparse. origin/main at allocation is 80.
// 81 -> 82: Java and Kotlin ParsedFile capture side channels now carry
// programmatic Spring lookup facts. A warm v81 cache has no such facts, so it
// would skip workers and silently omit the new INJECTS edges. origin/main at
// allocation is 81.
// 82 -> 83: Java Lombok @Data/@Getter/@Setter accessor synthesis emits
// synthetic Method nodes, HAS_METHOD edges, and matching scope captures into
// ParseWorkerResult / ParsedFile. A warm v82 cache replays pre-Lombok worker
// output and silently omits those callables. origin/main at allocation is 82.
// 83 -> 84: Kotlin val/var properties synthesize JVM get/set Method nodes
// (same provider hook as Java Lombok). A warm v83 cache omits those callables.
// origin/main at allocation is 83 (Java Lombok on this branch).
// 84 -> 85: JVM synthetic accessor captures now use the declaration
// qualified_name key consumed by scope extraction, and Kotlin accessor planning
// follows JvmAbi naming plus conservative @JvmName suppression. A warm v84
// cache can replay stale names and declaration metadata.
// 85 -> 86: Kotlin interface property accessors now record isAbstract on the
// synthetic Method. A warm v85 cache replays them as concrete.
// 86 -> 87: ModuleConstants gained wildcardImports (static-import-asterisk
// materialization) — a warm v86 cache has no wildcard bindings, so folding
// would skip them and drop wildcard-imported route constants. origin/main at
// allocation is 86 (#2885).
// 87 -> 88: Java ModuleConstants now preserves unfoldable declaration names
// across worker/cache replay so wildcard expansion cannot resurrect an imported
// member hidden by a local field. A warm v87 cache lacks that shadow metadata.
// 88 -> 89: the same side channels now carry Spring messaging facts — the
// arguments of non-HTTP handler annotations (`@KafkaListener(topics = ...)`)
// and a new `springMessageProducerFacts` list for template publishes
// (`KafkaTemplate.send`, `RabbitTemplate`/`JmsTemplate.convertAndSend`,
// `StreamBridge.send`). Both are parse-time worker output replayed verbatim
// from `ParsedFile.captureSideChannel`, so a warm v88 cache would skip workers
// and hand the annotation facts back with no `args` and the producer list
// empty. Measured on the fixture app: a warm all-cache-hit run
// (`usedWorkerPool=false`, `reparsedFileCount=0`) reproduces 6 Java and 7
// Kotlin producer facts purely from the store, which is exactly the state a
// pre-change cache would have served as zero. origin/main at allocation is 88.
// RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main AND OPEN PRs IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING — this
// entry was allocated 83 first, and five bumps landed upstream before it merged.
// 89 -> 90 (#2865): route decorator captures now carry `handlerName` in
// `decoratorRoutes`, which is what lets `resolveRouteHandlerSymbols` stamp
// `handlerSymbolId` and the routes phase emit the definition-level
// HANDLES_ROUTE edge. The field is minted in the parse WORKER and persisted
// verbatim, so a warm v89 cache replays handler-less decorator routes: every
// route loses its definition-level association on incremental analyze while
// every cold-run test passes — the inert-feature trap the entries above record.
// 89 is now taken by merged #3128. 90 is the next free value above origin/main
// (89) and above every in-flight claim found by scanning open PRs'
// parse-cache.ts at their exact head SHAs (highest other open claim was still
// ≤88). RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main AND OPEN PRs IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// 90 -> 91 (#3130): Kotlin providers now emit Spring decoratorRoutes plus
// ModuleConstants shadow metadata. A warm v90 cache would replay unchanged
// Kotlin files with neither route candidates nor the constant declarations
// needed to fold them, leaving the new ingestion path silently inert.
// 91 -> 92 (#1432): the shared callable-flow reader (`callable-flow-captures.ts`)
// no longer names a callee by simple name for a MEMBER call and gates a
// field-stored-callable invoke on a visible member store — parse-time capture
// facts for Kotlin / C++ / C# / TypeScript member calls change (the
// scope-capture bench re-baselined all four), and Zig files are captured for
// the first time, with rules that changed within the PR (qualified struct
// literals, enum-variant field bindings, receiver tagging). A warm v91 cache
// replays the old facts verbatim, `--force` included: a reviewer re-testing a
// later head of this PR on an index built from an earlier one measured a
// byte-identical graph until `parse-cache/` and `parsedfile-cache/` were
// deleted by hand. 92 is the next free value above origin/main (91) at merge
// time. RE-CHECK AGAINST origin/main AND OPEN PRs IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MERGING.
// v93: Zig call captures inside a comptime-false branch carry
// `@reference.static-gated` (feat/zig-static-gated-edges); the site gains
// `staticGated` and the CALLS edge a BOOLEAN column.
// v94: Objective-C now elides bare, file-scope macro markers before parsing.
// A warm v93 cache can retain error-recovered trees and provider facts that
// omit Objective-C declarations following markers such as RCT_EXTERN_C_END.
// v95: Objective-C header classification no longer treats framework `#import`
// alone as Objective-C syntax. A warm v94 cache can replay Objective-C worker
// output for a C++ header during `--force`, even though the current classifier
// routes that same header through the C++ provider.
// v96: Objective-C macro-marker preprocessing recognizes all C preprocessing
// whitespace before a directive or bare marker. A warm v95 cache can retain
// error-recovered facts for sources that begin those lines with form feed or
// vertical tab.
// v97: Objective-C macro-marker preprocessing recognizes comment-prefixed
// directives and rejects invalid numeric marker prefixes. A warm v96 cache can
// replay error-recovered facts from the previous normalization behavior.
// v98 (#3219): `ZIG_SCOPE_QUERY` gained three `@reference.value-ref` rules —
// bare call argument, qualified call argument (with `@reference.receiver`), and
// const-binding initialiser — so a Zig callable named in VALUE position now
// produces a `value-ref` entry in `ParsedFile.referenceSites` where it produced
// none before. These captures are PARSE-TIME facts, so a warm pre-v98 cache
// replays unchanged `.zig` files with zero value-ref sites, `--force` included
// (shards are content-addressed): `emitPropertyDispatchCalls` then emits no
// USES edge, `callableValueReferenceBoundaries` measures a real zero, and
// `impact` on a registered accessor republishes `epistemic: "exact"` — the exact
// #3399 defect this change exists to close, silently un-fixed.
// v99: ParsedImport retains declaredAtScope and export evidence changes in
// #3190. Old durable ParsedFiles lack the facts needed for scoped binding;
// invalidate both stores so warm indexing actually applies the correction.
// origin/main took 98 for #3219; 99 is the next free value.
// v100 (#3253): Rust import captures preserve the leading `::` that selects
// the extern prelude. Old warm captures erase it and cannot distinguish an
// absolute library import from a same-named local module. Reparse both stores.
// v101 (#3294 review): Rust bare-keyword glob imports retain crate/self/super
// instead of an empty target path; restricted pub(...) imports are no longer
// captured as unrestricted reexports. Re-extract both facts on warm indexes.
// v102: ParsedFile gained callResultAssignmentSites; old durable shards do
// not carry the exact assignment identity required by return-type replay.
// v103 (#3339 review): tRPC route extraction changed — nested-router paths,
// a tightened entry gate, and controller-less routes now bind handlers via a
// same-file CALLS edge. Warm caches replay the flat pre-fix capture set
// verbatim (route rows are parse-time facts), so both stores re-extract.
// v104 (#3339 review): TS/JS pair-HOC queries now name object-pair
// `mutation(withAuth(arrow))` handlers. Warm caches replay the pre-fix
// capture set (anonymous arrows, no Function name), so both stores re-extract.
// v112 (#3354): callable-value flow now follows each branch of `a ?? f`,
// `a || f`, and `c ? f : g`. Warm caches replay the pre-fix flow facts, which
// have no flow for those assignments, so both stores re-extract. 105-111 are
// claimed by open PR #3326 (Elixir).
// Same v112: the `valueAlternatives` provider hook extends it to Kotlin
// `?:`/`if`, Swift/Dart `??`/`?:`, and Python `x if c else y`, and keeps a
// Ruby multi-statement `if` one opaque source.
// v113 (#3371): `.ipynb` code cells are extracted to Python before parse.
// Warm caches keyed on raw JSON would replay empty/failed Python parses.
// v114 (#2965): C and C++ angle includes are real wildcard imports with
// `isSystem`. Warm shards stored those captures as absent, so incremental
// analyze never asked the resolver to search include paths. 113 is #3371.
// v115 (#3390): Python call captures now carry `@reference.arity` when the
// argument count is statically known. Warm v114 ParsedFiles lack that fact, so
// arity-aware method filtering would remain inert for every unchanged file.
// v116 (#3390 follow-up): Python's private capture side-channel now records
// simple-positional call sites and fixed positional method capacity. Warm v115
// ParsedFiles lack those facts, so conservative mixin subtype dispatch would
// suppress unchanged one-argument callers.
// v117 (#3390 private-only successor): simple-positional call entries now carry
// their count privately, while ordinary Python references no longer receive
// synthetic arity. Warm v116 ParsedFiles have neither equivalent fact.
// v118 (#3398): decorated Python methods with unproven decorator identity no
// longer publish subtype positional capacity. Warm v117 side-channel snapshots
// would retain that capacity and could emit a false concrete call target.
// v119 (#3396): Python subtype method capacities now omit receiverless ordinary
// methods. Warm v118 ParsedFiles would replay a false compatible target.
// v120 (#3394): decorated Python method receiver bindings now distinguish
// unproven decorators from instance receivers. Warm v119 ParsedFiles would
// replay a fabricated `self` binding or lack the uncertainty marker entirely.
// v121 (#3399 follow-up): Python decorator identity now ignores trailing
// comments, honors rebinding of builtin descriptor names visible where the
// decorator is evaluated, and withholds subtype capacity from descriptor
// stacks. Warm v120 captures carry the old verdicts.
// v122 (#3414): Python decorator identity models restoring helper calls and
// treats match-pattern captures and nested nonlocal rebinds as shadowing.
// Warm v121 captures carry the old verdicts.
// v123 (#3408): FastAPI include records now carry `host`, router imports carry
// `modulePath`, and unprefixed child includes are emitted. Warm v122 records
// lack them, so nested router-prefix propagation would stay inert.
// v124 (#3402): Go files now emit gin/echo `decoratorRoutes` carrying a
