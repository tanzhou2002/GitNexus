 * hashes for the run. Counting its own output as a repository change makes
 * every completed run look immediately out of date, which is the regression
 * PR #1233 introduced and #1233's fix excluded these paths to prevent.
 *
 * Two freshness checks depend on this list agreeing: `isWorkingTreeDirty`
 * (analyze's up-to-date fast-path gate) and the per-file comparison behind
 * `status`. They used to hold separate copies of it, so a path added to one
 * silently became a permanent "stale" verdict in the other. One list, imported
 * by both.
