 * stay in `repo-manager.ts`, which re-exports these so existing import sites
 * keep working unchanged.
 *
 * The metadata READ primitives this module needs (`getStoragePath`, `loadMeta`,
 * `RepoMeta`) come from `repo-meta.ts`, a leaf below both modules — NOT from
 * `repo-manager.ts`. Importing them from there made the two modules import
 * values out of each other, and the only thing keeping that ESM-safe was that
 * neither side called across at module-evaluation time. Reading from the layer
 * below removes the cycle instead of depending on that timing.
