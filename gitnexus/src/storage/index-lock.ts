/**
 * Cross-process single-writer lock for a GitNexus index directory (#2658).
 *
 * `analyze` is the only writer of a `.gitnexus/` (or `branches/<slug>/`) slot,
 * but nothing stopped two `analyze` runs — e.g. two editor/agent SessionStart
 * hooks firing on the same repo at once — from wiping and rebuilding the same
 * store concurrently. They raced on `lbug` and its sidecars, wasted N× CPU
 * producing one index, and left orphaned WAL fragments (#2637). This module
 * gives the write path an exclusive, index-directory-scoped lock so a second
 * writer waits for the first instead of colliding; after acquiring, the caller
 * re-runs its normal freshness check, so a run whose work the holder already
 * did exits up-to-date rather than rebuilding (single-flight coalescing).
 *
 * Ownership lives with the process that runs the pipeline (the heap-respawn
 * child when a respawn happens, the original otherwise) — NOT a supervising
 * parent — so the entity the OS tracks for liveness is always the real writer.
 * See run-analyze.ts for the acquire site.
 *
 * TWO BACKENDS behind the {@link acquireIndexLock} seam:
 *
 *  - **socket** (Windows named pipe / Linux abstract socket, via `net`) — the
 *    preferred, KERNEL-OWNED lock. Holding it = holding a listening endpoint the
 *    kernel binds to this process; `EADDRINUSE` therefore means a *live* holder,
 *    and the kernel drops the binding the instant the holder exits for ANY reason
 *    (clean exit, crash, OOM, SIGKILL). That makes it provably race-free: no
 *    stale detection, no pid-reuse guess, no takeover, and — since the endpoint
 *    lives outside the index dir — no filesystem write, so it works unchanged on
 *    a read-only index mount. This is the same class of kernel object as the
 *    Windows named mutex the issue's reporter used as an external workaround, but
 *    built from Node's stdlib `net`, so it adds NO native dependency and cannot
 *    break `npx gitnexus` install anywhere.
 *
 *  - **file** (`O_EXCL` pidfile) — the portable fallback for macOS/BSD (no
 *    abstract sockets; filesystem sockets don't release cleanly on death) and
 *    for any environment where the socket backend can't bind. It uses pid-
 *    liveness staleness, a non-stealable acquisition/reclaim guard, bounded
 *    malformed-file handling, read-only tolerance, and a finite wait timeout (a
 *    reused pid can masquerade as live where process start-time isn't verifiable, so waiting is
 *    bounded rather than a hang). Every file acquisition participates in the
 *    guard, even for an empty slot. An orphan guard fails closed and requires
 *    quiesced manual recovery (RUNBOOK.md); socket locks avoid that tradeoff.
 *    Requires reliable local-filesystem O_EXCL and cooperating upgraded writers.
 *
 * Scope: cross-process, same logical index dir. The file backend never steals a
 * foreign-host lock (pid liveness is meaningless across hosts); the socket
 * backend is single-host by nature. The motivating case (local hook-driven
 * re-index) is single-host. See AcquireOptions.timeoutMs for the wait ceiling.
