 * `Method→File` (Vue Options-API handler), `Namespace→Record` (COBOL
 * `DECLARATIVES`), `Class→Tool` (`@mcp.tool()` on a class). Declaring
 * {@link DEFINITION_ANCHOR_LABELS} × this set covers all four plus every
 * sibling the same emitters can reach.
 *
 * TWO TARGETS USE ONLY PART OF THEIR CROSS PRODUCT TODAY, and it over-declares
 * for them ON PURPOSE (~45 of the 182 attachment pairs have no emitter that can
 * reach them right now):
 *  - `Community` — `isCommunitySymbol` (`community-processor.ts`) admits only
 *    `Function` / `Class` / `Method` / `Interface` as members, so the other 22
 *    anchors cannot source a MEMBER_OF edge until that predicate widens.
 *  - `Route` — HANDLES_ROUTE always sources the literal
 *    `generateId('File', handlerPath)`, and additionally the route's HANDLER
 *    DEFINITION whenever `routeHandlerSymbols` produced an id that
 *    `ctx.graph.getNode` confirms is in the graph. That second anchor is a
 *    lookup result the emitter never label-checks; handler resolution returns
 *    `Function` / `Method` definitions today, so `Route` is no longer a
 *    `File`-only target and the remaining anchors are headroom.
 *
 * Those pairs stay declared because the two sides of the error are not
 * symmetric: an UNDECLARED pair makes LadybugDB reject the edge and aborts
 * `analyze` outright on a user's repo, while an unused DECLARED pair costs
 * almost nothing — `bench/schema-pairs` measured the pre-#2801 332→450 growth
 * (118 pairs, of which these ~45 are a part) at 0.93–1.05×, i.e. inside
 * run-to-run noise. #2801's 11 generated `Record` pairs bring the total to 461.
 * Its Windows measurements and noise caveats live in the benchmark README; the
 * operational production ceiling is the checked 1.5× budget.
 * Every one of the four aborts above came from re-narrowing a set to what one
 * predicate looked like it allowed — so a reading of `isCommunitySymbol` is not
 * grounds to shrink this. `Route` is the worked example in the other direction:
 * the definition-level HANDLES_ROUTE edge started emitting `Function|Route` /
 * `Method|Route` with no DDL change, because those pairs were already declared.
 * Widening `isCommunitySymbol`, or handler resolution returning a further
 * label, is likewise a no-op here.
 *
 * `Route` / `Tool` being excluded as ANCHORS (see {@link NON_DEFINITION_LABELS})
 * is likewise a SIZE choice, not something derived from a rule: they do source
 * `ENTRY_POINT_OF`, and admitting them would mint twelve further pairs no
 * emitter can currently reach.
 *
 * Sized deliberately. `bench/schema-pairs` measures real `@ladybugdb/core` with
 * identical data — untyped-endpoint anchored queries
 * (`MATCH (a {id: $id})-[r:CodeRelation]->(b)`, the shape `impact` / `context` /
 * `detect_changes` issue), relative to the 332-pair hand-list it replaced.
 * Keep the historical reference-box and current Windows measurements separate:
 *
 *   reference box: 450 → 0.93–1.05×   641 → 1.22–1.43×   1024 → 2.03–2.34×
 *   Windows:       461 → 1.20–1.42× across three comparable runs
 *
 * Those rows are not a cross-machine ordering, and none of them was re-measured
 * for the sizes the DDL has actually reached since: adding `Destination` to this
 * list took it from 482 to 509 pairs (26 generated by this rule plus the one
 * hand-declared `Destination→Property`). The 461 the rows above were quoted for
 * is a HISTORICAL size, not the current one — read them as the shape of the
 * cost curve, not as a measurement of today's table. The operational claim is
 * unchanged in kind: 509 is still far below the 1024 row where the curve turns,
 * and the 1.5× production budget has not been re-checked at this size. The
 * historical same-box 450→641 comparison still shows the cost of the deferred
 * third cross product, so the containment half below stays hand-declared.
 * Re-run all candidate sizes on one box and quote the range before proposing
 * that rule — or before adding a further attachment target.

 * The pairs NEITHER rule above generates — everything left after the two

 *
 * What survives here is characteristic, not arbitrary. Almost all of it is a
 * TARGET no rule reaches — `CodeElement`, `Impl`, `Namespace`, `Template`,
 * `Typedef`, `Static`, `Section`, `Folder` are in neither
 * `SCOPE_BRIDGE_TARGET_LABELS` nor {@link ATTACHMENT_TARGET_LABELS} — plus the
 * `Impl|*` and `Template|*` member rows (Rust `impl`/`trait` bodies, C++
 * templates), the two `Route|Process` / `Tool|Process` entry points whose
 * emitter names both labels as literals, and `BasicBlock|BasicBlock`, the PDG
 * substrate.
 * Spring dynamic lookup in a constructor also emits INJECTS to a synthetic
 * @Bean CodeElement (#3238), so Constructor|CodeElement belongs here.
 *
 * NOTHING A RULE ALREADY COVERS BELONGS HERE. `generatedRelationPairs` skips
 * any pair present in this block, so a redundant line does not merely duplicate
 * — it SUPPRESSES generation, and later narrowing a rule would silently keep
 * that pair alive with no test failing. 166 such lines now live in the generated
 * half (161 from #2793, the three `Record` member pairs moved by #2801/#2871,
 * and the two `TypeAlias` pairs moved by R2-2 here);
 * `test/unit/schema-pair-coverage.test.ts` now fails if one comes back.
 *
 * Those last two arrived by MERGE, and the shape is worth recording because it
 * is the one this block's warning cannot catch by itself. #2871 and this branch
 * each deleted their OWN label's hand-written pairs — `Record` there,
 * `TypeAlias` here — for the identical reason, in the identical region. Git
 * presents that as one conflict in which each side appears to be deleting the
 * other's lines, and "keep ours" or "keep theirs" both resolve cleanly, compile,
 * and silently re-suppress the other label's generation. The correct resolution
 * is neither: take the UNION of the deletions. Verified by asserting all five
 * pairs are still present in the emitted DDL — a check that does not read
 * `LINKABLE_LABELS`, unlike the pair-coverage test, which derives both sides
 * from it and so moves with any change to it.
 *
 * Folding this remainder into a third cross product
 * (`DEFINITION_ANCHOR_LABELS × {CodeElement, Section, Typedef,
 * Namespace, Impl, TypeAlias, Static, Template}`) would take the table to 641
 * pairs and leave only ~29 lines here. `bench/schema-pairs` measures 641 at
 * 1.22–1.43× on the historical reference box; current production's 461 pairs
 * remain below their 1.5× Windows budget. Those cross-machine values are not an
 * ordering, so any proposal must remeasure both sizes on one box. Until then,
 * the rule stays deferred rather than trading ~40 lines for unmeasured query cost.
 *
 * Exported so `test/unit/schema-pair-coverage.test.ts` can subtract it and
 * assert the GENERATED region of the DDL for exact equality against the two
 * rules, rather than one-directional containment.
 * `test/integration/structural-pair-coverage.test.ts` guards this half from a
 * corpus — that is the guard, not this comment.

 * was created from this build's DDL. It could not: the number collided with
 * `main` eight times, twice EXACTLY, and an exact clash was the quiet failure —
 * two builds stamp the same number over different DDL, the strict `===` gate
 * reads the index as current, every `CREATE … TABLE` is skipped as "already
 * exists" (suppressed in `runSchemaCreationQueries`), and the edges whose
 * endpoint pair the live DB cannot persist are dropped by
 * `fallbackRelationshipInserts`' bare `catch`. A wrong graph, not an error.
 *
 * A digest cannot collide BY ACCIDENT at this scale: 12 hex chars is 48 bits,
 * so even 1,000 distinct DDL variants over the project's whole life put the
 * birthday probability of any pair matching at ≈1.8e-9. Two builds agree
 * exactly when their DDL agrees, so concurrent branches never need renumbering.
 * Do not shorten the slice: the odds double per bit dropped. On mismatch —
 * including the ABSENT stamp every pre-#2798 index carries — run-analyze warns
 * and forces a full re-analyze, which wipes the database and recreates the
 * tables from the DDL below.
 *
 * {@link EMBEDDING_SCHEMA} is deliberately EXCLUDED. Its `FLOAT[N]` width comes
 * from `GITNEXUS_EMBEDDING_DIMS` at module load, so folding it in would make
 * this a function of the ENVIRONMENT rather than of code: two runs of the same
 * build under different env would disagree and force alternating full rebuilds.
 * Vector-column drift is therefore a SEPARATE gate, not an ungated hazard:
 * {@link embeddingDimsMismatch} compares the width stamped in
 * `RepoMeta.embeddingDims` against {@link EMBEDDING_DIMS} and run-analyze
 * forces a rebuild on drift. Do not merge the two — an env-derived value in a
 * code digest makes the same build disagree with itself. (The older reaction in
 * run-analyze remains, and is to the CACHE, not the schema: when the cached
 * vectors' length differs from `EMBEDDING_DIMS` it discards the cache and
 * re-embeds.)

 * here keeps the fingerprint purely code-derived and still gates the width —

 * fired no guard at all: `alreadyUpToDate` returned over a `FLOAT[384]` table
 * while the process embedded at 768. (The one pre-existing reaction, in
 * run-analyze, discards the embedding CACHE and re-embeds — into a column whose
 * width was never revisited.) A single scalar, so plain equality suffices.
 *
 * ABSENT does NOT count as a mismatch — the opposite of
 * {@link schemaFingerprintMismatch}, and deliberately:
 *
 *  - Absence carries no signal about the width. A missing fingerprint means
 *    "DDL this build cannot vouch for", and the field ships WITH a DDL change,
 *    so absence is itself evidence of drift. A missing dims stamp means only
 *    "written before the field existed"; the width was whatever that run's env
 *    resolved, almost always the 384 default, and it was consistent with the
 *    table it wrote. Drift needs the env to CHANGE, which absence says nothing
 *    about.
 *  - Forcing on absence would buy no safety anyway. Every index that lacks this
 *    stamp also lacks `schemaFingerprint` (both landed together in #2798), and
 *    that guard already forces a rebuild for exactly those indexes — after
 *    which the width is stamped and the hazard is closed for good. A second
 *    trigger for the same one rebuild is dead weight that would keep firing
 *    forever on any future path that legitimately omits the stamp.
 *  - The cost of guessing wrong is asymmetric: a fleet-wide full re-analyze
 *    (minutes to hours per repo) for a hazard that requires a rare, deliberate
 *    env change.
 *
 * Absence is precisely `undefined`. Any other recorded value that is not this
 * build's width — including a malformed one, since `meta.json` is a schema-less
 * `JSON.parse` of on-disk state — reads as a mismatch and errs toward a
 * rebuild, which is the safe direction.
 *
 * Pure + exported for testing, and takes `current` explicitly rather than
 * closing over {@link EMBEDDING_DIMS}: that constant is frozen at module load,
 * so a parameter is the only way to exercise both sides of the comparison.
 * Lives here rather than in run-analyze for the reason
 * `cjkSegmentationModeMismatch` lives in `core/search/` — a caller that only
 * needs the comparator should not have to pull in the analyze pipeline.
