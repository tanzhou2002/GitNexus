 * (#2317/#2323), so a row-count-only cap lets a handful of huge rows build an
 * unbounded `buffer.join('\n')` string before ever tripping it.
 *
 * Not an env knob — fixed by a safety margin, not a preference. The one worst
 * case that matters: one more oversized row lands right after the buffer was
 * just under this threshold, before the flush fires. That row is capped at
 * TREE_SITTER_MAX_BUFFER (32MB, hard-clamped — GITNEXUS_MAX_FILE_SIZE cannot
 * raise it). Two transforms can each grow it before it reaches the buffer:
 * `applyCjkSegmentationIfEnabled` (#2331, `CJK_BIGRAM_WORST_CASE_GROWTH_FACTOR`
 * on an all-CJK row when `GITNEXUS_FTS_CJK_SEGMENTATION=bigram` — the single
 * source of truth for that ratio, imported by the paired test) and
 * `escapeCSVField`'s worst-case quote-doubling (2x). So the peak joined-string

 *   FLUSH_BYTES + 2 * CJK_BIGRAM_WORST_CASE_GROWTH_FACTOR * TREE_SITTER_MAX_BUFFER
 *     ≈ 8MB + 149MB ≈ 157MB,
 * versus Node's `buffer.constants.MAX_STRING_LENGTH` (~512MB) — the test
 * actually enforces half of that (~256MB), for a ~1.63x margin (see the
 * `shouldFlushCSVBuffer stays within the V8 string-length ceiling` test,
 * which fails loudly if any of these constants ever moves this margin the
 * wrong way). With segmentation disabled (default), the old ~3.56x margin
 * still applies. Raising FLUSH_BYTES trades fewer/larger flushes for less
 * margin; lowering it trades the reverse for lower peak transient memory.
 * Change the constant directly if a real workload needs a different point on
 * that curve — a per-host env var would let the margin get silently
 * reintroduced by an operator with no way to know why 512MB is dangerous.

 * a handful of giant tokens (each whole line, joined across lines), and a

 * whose content is `... \nfoo\n ...`. Removing the 10KB cap (#2333/#2317)
 * stores the full body but leaves it unsearchable; collapsing intra-text
 * whitespace to spaces is what actually makes every word searchable.
 *
 * This rewrites the STORED column too (the same value is COPYed in), so File
 * content returned via the graph API is space-flattened — an accepted trade
 * for making file/symbol text searchable. Leading/trailing/empty are no-ops.
 *
 * Callers apply `applyCjkSegmentationIfEnabled` (#2331) to the text *before*
 * this flatten, so a CJK phrase split across a line-wrap loses its boundary
 * bigram (run detection resets at whitespace) — an accepted limitation, see
 * the plan's Scope Boundaries.
 *
 * Exported (#2339) so `bm25-index.ts`'s query path can compose it in the

 * text transforms symmetric — a literal tab/newline in a query would
 * otherwise fail to match whitespace-normalized indexed content.
