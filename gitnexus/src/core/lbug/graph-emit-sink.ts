/**
 * Streaming structural graph-emit sink (issue #2680).
 *
 * `analyze` holds the whole `KnowledgeGraph` on the main thread for the entire
 * pipeline, so peak heap is O(repo) — ~2.1 KB/node at Linux-kernel scale
 * (#2649). Measurement on a kernel-shaped synthetic graph (400k nodes,
 * 2.7 edges/node) says where that goes:
 *
 *   nodes only .......  367 B/node
 *   nodes + edges .... 2075 B/node   <- reproduces the #2649 figure
 *
 * So **relationships are ~83% of graph heap** (~646 B/edge), and that is what
 * this sink removes. 646 B for an object holding four short strings is the cost
 * of storing every edge four times over — `relationshipMap`, a
 * `relationshipsByType` bucket, and both endpoints' `edgeIdsByNode` Sets — plus
 * an `id` that concatenates both endpoint ids. (Dropping just the two redundant
 * indexes was measured too: 174 of 648 B/edge, ~1.3x. Not enough on its own.)
 *
 * Nodes are deliberately NOT streamed: they are the other 17%, and two
 * scope-resolution index builders (`buildGraphNodeLookup`,
 * `buildGraphCallableAnchorIndex`) scan them.
 *
 * ## How much this actually saves — read this before quoting a number
 *
 * Measured A/B against the object-based graph, 400k nodes / 1.08M edges, all
 * edges streamable (the worst case for this design): **823 MB -> 626 MB, ~1.3x**,
 * with all 1.08M edges still visible through `iterRelationships`.
 *
 * That is well short of the ~2.9x a naive `0.17 + 0.83 * 0.21` retained-share
 * calculation suggests, and the gap is deliberate: this sink is *lossless*, so
 * it pays for the {@link streamedIds} dedup Set (one unique id string per
 * streamed edge) and the columns above. An earlier revision hit a bigger number
 * by disabling community detection, process extraction and the taint fixpoint —
 * which is why it could not be the default. 1.3x with nothing traded away is the
 * honest figure; if a future change needs more, the next lever is dedup keyed on
 * the interned column triple rather than on id strings (it must first be shown
 * not to alter the emitted row SET).
 *
 * ## What it costs — measured, not assumed
 *
 * Measured on the same 400k-node / 1.08M-edge graph, all edges streamable, each
 * arm running what its own consumers actually call:
 *
 *   heap  819 MB -> 584 MB   (1.40x better)
 *   scans  ~78 ms -> ~88 ms  (parity, within run-to-run noise)
 *
 * Linear in both: verified at 100k/200k/400k/800k nodes, per-edge scan cost flat
 * (~13 ns both arms) and the heap ratio drifting only 1.7x -> 1.5x as interner
 * indices gain digits. No super-linear term, so a larger repo costs
 * proportionally more, not disproportionately.
 *
 * The dedup key encodes its tail SEGMENT COUNT, which measurably costs ~66 MB
 * here versus omitting it. That is not optional: without it a one-segment tail
 * `:7` and a two-segment `:7:0` collapse onto one key and an edge is silently
 * dropped (regression test in graph-emit-sink.test.ts).
 *
 * Getting there took three measured steps, because the naive version was 6.8x
 * WORSE (651 ms) — reads rebuild objects, and a real analyze performs SIX full
 * relationship scans (the pruner, community detection x2, process extraction x2,
 * and the taint fixpoint's CALLS pass):
 *
 * 1. The ~150-character synthesized `id` was built eagerly on every read — 6.5M
 *    concatenations for a field no in-pipeline consumer reads. Isolating it
 *    showed 436 ms of the regression. It is now a lazy prototype getter on
 *    {@link StreamedRelationship}.
 * 2. Generator and iterator-protocol overhead: {@link forEachRelationship} loops
 *    the columns directly, and {@link iterRelationships} reuses one
 *    iterator-result record. Note a hand-rolled iterator allocating a fresh
 *    `{value, done}` per edge measured WORSE (252 ms) than the generator it
 *    replaced, so the obvious rewrite is not the one that shipped.
 * 3. The remaining ~90 ms was object allocation itself, irreducible while the
 *    read API returns objects — so the five whole-graph scans moved to
 *    `forEachRelationshipFields`, which passes the five fields they actually
 *    read as primitives and allocates nothing. See
 *    {@link GraphEmitSink.forEachRelationshipFields}.
 *
 * The last allocating scan is the taint fixpoint's `iterRelationshipsByType`
 * pass; it is one scan of six and accounts for the small residual. Give it a
 * by-type field variant only if a measurement says it matters.
 *
 * It is in any case NOT O(chunk) — node identity and the resolution registries
 * stay O(repo). True O(chunk) needs DB-side resolution and Leiden (#2337), at
 * which point this sink should be deleted rather than extended.
 *
 * ## Correctness contract
 *
 * Structural sibling of {@link PdgEmitSink}, and reuses its row builder
 * (`buildRelRow`), header (`REL_CSV_HEADER`) and pair classification
 * (`relPairKeyFor`, which is also what `RelPairRouter` routes and skips by), so
 * the streamed row SET equals the whole-graph emit's and the bulk COPY loads
 * the same rows. Set-level, not
 * byte-level: rows stream in emit order and are not re-sorted under
 * `GITNEXUS_SORT_GRAPH_OUTPUT`.

 *                          member-lookup, and 9 language scope-resolvers

 *   HAS_PROPERTY         - di phase, ruby scope-resolver, spring config-bindings
 *   METHOD_OVERRIDES,
 *   METHOD_IMPLEMENTS    - mro-processor
 *   DEFINES              - local-symbol-pruner's isFileDefinesEdge test
 *   INJECTS              - di phase fan-out
 *   HANDLES_ROUTE        - Spring Actuator runtime handler conflict detection
 *
 * Deliberately NOT retained: STEP_IN_PROCESS / ENTRY_POINT_OF / MEMBER_OF
 * (written only by the `processes` / `communities` phases, which the streaming
 * flag disables), TAINT_PATH / CALL_SUMMARY (their phases are likewise gated
 * off under the flag), and HANDLES_TOOL (written by `tools`, never read back
 * mid-pipeline).
 *
 * Adding a relationship type that a phase reads back WITHOUT adding it here is
 * a silent-wrong-graph bug, not a crash. The differential round-trip test cannot:
 * `addRelationship` partitions edges
 * between the graph and the CSVs, and the union of a partition is invariant
 * under where the partition line falls, so that test stays green no matter how
 * this set is drawn. Only the read-site audit protects this invariant; re-run it
 * (grep iterRelationshipsByType / iterRelationships / forEachRelationship /
 * removeRelationship across src/) when adding a phase or a relationship type.
