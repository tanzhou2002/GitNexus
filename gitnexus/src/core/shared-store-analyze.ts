/**
 * Analyze-side operations for the shared sibling store (#3352).
 *
 * A shared checkout slot is in one of two states:
 *   - pointer: metadata records `graphPath` (a commit graph in the store);
 *              the slot has no graph of its own.
 *   - private: the slot owns `<slot>/lbug`; no `graphPath`.
 *
 * Analyze always writes the private path. `ensurePrivateSharedGraph` turns a
 * pointer into a private copy just before the first graph open/write, so a
 * clean checkout that hits the up-to-date fast path copies nothing.
 * `publishSharedGraph` runs after a successful analyze: a clean checkout at
 * HEAD moves its private graph into `commits/` (or drops it when that commit
 * graph already exists) and becomes a pointer again. Commit graphs are never
 * written after publish.
