/**
 * What happened to `contracts.json` on a given sync.
 *
 * - `written`       — the contracts extracted by this run replaced the file.
 * - `preserved`     — nothing could be read, so the previous run's `contracts`,
 *                     `crossLinks` and `repoSnapshots` were kept verbatim and
 *                     only the diagnostic fields (`missingRepos` /
 *                     `unreadableRepos`) were refreshed to describe this run.
 * - `no-prior-registry` — nothing could be read AND there was no prior
 *                     contracts.json to carry forward (or it would not parse),
 *                     so nothing was written at all. Split out from
 *                     `preserved` because the operator-facing sentence differs:
 *                     telling someone their previous contracts are safe when
 *                     the group has never synced sends them looking for a file
 *                     that does not exist.
 * - `superseded`    — nothing could be read, and while this run waited for the
 *                     group lock another sync replaced contracts.json. That
 *                     file was left exactly as it is and NOTHING was written:
 *                     this run's diagnostics describe a group state older than
 *                     what is on disk. Distinct from `preserved` because the
 *                     two differ in what happened to the file, which is the
 *                     only thing this value is for — `preserved` rewrote it,
 *                     this did not touch it.
 * - `not-attempted` — the caller asked not to write (`skipWrite`, or no
 *                     `groupDir` was supplied).
