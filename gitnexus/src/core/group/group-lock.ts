/**
 * Cross-process single-writer lock for one group's persisted state (R9).
 *
 * A group sync ends by REPLACING `contracts.json` and rebuilding `bridge.lbug`
 * from a snapshot it computed minutes earlier. Two syncs of the same group that
 * overlap therefore do not merge — the second one's write simply overwrites the
 * first one's, and whichever finishes last wins with a registry assembled from
 * repo state the other run never saw. Nothing detects it afterwards: both runs
 * report success, and the group's contracts silently describe a mixture that was
 * never true at any instant. This module serializes that section so one sync at
 * a time can be inside it.
 *
 * WHERE THE LOCK LIVES. On a dedicated `sync-lock` directory INSIDE the group
 * directory — mirroring `withRegistryLock`, which locks a `registry-lock`
 * directory beside the registry rather than the registry's own directory
 * (repo-manager.ts). {@link acquireIndexLock} is NOT reentrant and its file
 * backend writes `analyze.lock` into the directory it is handed, so pointing it
 * at a directory that some other code path might also lock — or that already
 * holds a per-repo index slot — reintroduces exactly the collision the registry
 * lock's own comment warns about. `<groupDir>/sync-lock` is a namespace nothing
 * else claims: group directories live under `~/.gitnexus/groups/<name>` (or
 * `$GITNEXUS_HOME`), never under a repo's `.gitnexus[/branches/<slug>]`.
 *
 * WHY IT FAILS CLOSED, like the registry lock. `withRegistryLock` also
 * refuses to continue unlocked on timeout: a lost registry update can drop a
 * concurrent registration. A group sync still fails closed for additional
 * reasons — it is long, expensive, operator-initiated, and a lost update
 * destroys contracts rather than a registry field.
 * A sync that cannot be protected must not run at all, and there are three
 * distinct ways it can fail to be protected; all three throw
 * {@link GroupSyncLockError}:
 *
 *   1. TIMEOUT — a live holder still held the lock when the ceiling
 *      elapsed, or an unrecoverable acquisition/reclaim guard leftover
 *      exhausted the guard wait (see RUNBOOK.md).
 *   2. LOCK-FREE DEGRADATION — `acquireIndexLock` answers a read-only or
 *      permission-denied filesystem with a no-op handle that is byte-identical
 *      to a real one at the API boundary. That is a deliberate tolerance for
 *      `analyze` (an unwritable index dir rejects every write anyway, so the
 *      lock is moot), but here it would hand back a handle that protects
 *      nothing while the sync went on to attempt its writes. The handle now
 *      carries {@link IndexLockHandle.lockFree}, so we can see it and refuse.
 *   3. ANY OTHER ACQUIRE FAILURE — e.g. `sync-lock` cannot be created because a
 *      regular file already occupies the path. Silently proceeding on an error
 *      we did not anticipate is the same unprotected run under another name.
 *
 * WHY THE CEILING IS PASSED EXPLICITLY. The magnitude is not the point — 10
 * minutes deliberately matches `acquireIndexLock`'s own default, because a group
 * sync is analyze-shaped and a legitimately queued second sync must be able to
 * wait out a full first one (the registry lock's 5s is sized for a sub-second
 * merge and is the wrong model here). The reason to pass it is
 * `resolveTimeoutMs`: it prefers an explicit argument over
 * `GITNEXUS_INDEX_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS`, and that variable's `<= 0` case resolves to
 * `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`. Inheriting it would let an environment turn this
 * lock's fail-closed timeout into an unbounded hang.
 *
 * ACQUIRED EXACTLY ONCE, by `syncGroup`, around its whole persist section.
 * Nothing it calls beneath that point — `writeContractRegistry`,
 * `refreshPreservedBridgeMeta`, `writeBridgeUnlocked` — takes this lock; a
 * second acquisition would deadlock a non-reentrant primitive on the HAPPY
 * path, not on some edge case. `bridge-db.ts` exports the swap in both forms
 * for exactly that reason: `writeBridgeUnlocked` for the held-lock caller
 * (`syncGroup`), and the `writeBridge` wrapper, which acquires here, for direct
 * callers that are outside the region. The same split `repo-manager.ts` uses
 * for `registerRepoUnlocked` / `registerRepo`.
 *
 * SCOPE CAVEAT (recorded, not solved): the default socket backend uses Linux
 * abstract sockets, which are network-namespace-scoped. Two containers that
 * share a bind-mounted group directory but sit in separate netns will NOT
 * contend, exactly as documented for the index lock itself; forcing
 * `GITNEXUS_INDEX_LOCK_BACKEND=file` is what covers that deployment.
