/**
 * Does the index still reflect the files it actually covers?
 *
 * `status` used to answer this with a repo-wide `git status --porcelain`
 * boolean, which says something different: whether the working tree differs
 * from HEAD. Those two questions diverge in both directions. A scratch file,
 * a build artifact, or a tracked file under a tool directory the indexer
 * never reads makes the tree dirty while every indexed file is byte-current —
 * and because `analyze` cannot commit or delete that file, the resulting
 * "stale (re-run gitnexus analyze)" verdict was unclearable (#3077). It also
 * misses the reverse case: reverting a file that was indexed while dirty
 * leaves a clean tree over an index holding the pre-revert content.
 *
 * `meta.fileHashes` already records the exact set of files the last run
 * covered, so the question can be answered directly. This module recomputes
 * the coverage set with the same `walkRepositoryPaths` scan (ignore rules and
 * dotfile handling stay shared) and the large-file cap recorded in
 * `meta.indexCoverage`, hashes only the paths that can actually have changed
 * since that run, and diffs against what was recorded.
