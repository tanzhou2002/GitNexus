/**
 * Kotlin binding for the language-agnostic constant resolver (#2391 core).
 *
 * Supplies the two Kotlin-specific pieces — {@link resolveKotlinImport} (import
 * specifier → file, honoring JVM package rules) and
 * {@link extractKotlinModuleConstants} (tree → {@link ModuleConstants}) — plus
 * the folding entry points {@link resolveKotlinConstant} and
 * {@link foldKotlinOperands}, so callers stay language-oblivious.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY SHARED WITH THE AGNOSTIC CORE. One value —
 * {@link MAX_FOLD_LENGTH} — and five types. The core's own `resolveConstant` /
 * `resolveOperands` are NOT called: the fold state machine below (cycle guard,
 * success memo, depth caps, operand concatenation — roughly 200 of this file's
 * lines) is a local fork, close enough to `java-const-resolver.ts`'s already
 * forked copy that the two read as the same code with the language name
 * swapped.
 *
 * That fork is a consequence, not an oversight. The core keys its maps by
 * SIMPLE name, and a Kotlin operand can be a QUALIFIED reference at any
 * position (`X = ApiPaths.Y + "/tail"`); handed to the core, `ApiPaths.Y` misses
 * every map and floors the whole chain to null — see {@link computeKotlinFold},
 * which resolves operands through the qualified-aware walk for exactly this
 * reason. The import chase is Kotlin-specific too: a member import is spelled
 * identically to a type import, so {@link resolveImportedName} has to try both
 * readings, and the core exposes no hook for that. Java forked first on the same
 * grounds. Teaching the core qualified names, and retiring both copies against
 * it, is the standing follow-up; until then the honest description of this file
 * is "a second fork", not "a binding over a shared fold".
 *
 * Kotlin shares the JVM package/import model with Java, so this binding mirrors
 * `java-const-resolver.ts` in structure, naming and skip-floor discipline. The
 * four places Kotlin genuinely differs are handled explicitly, not translated:
 *
 *  1. **Where a constant can live.** Java has one carrier (`static final` on a
 *     type). Kotlin has three: a top-level `const val`/`val`, a member of an
 *     `object`, and a member of a `companion object` — the last is referenced
 *     through its ENCLOSING class (`Holder.NAME`), not through `Companion`.
 *  2. **No `String` type gate.** Kotlin infers property types, so
 *     `const val ORDERS = "/orders"` carries no type node to check. The
 *     initializer decides: anything {@link parseKotlinConstOperands} cannot fold
 *     to a string (a number, a call, a template) drops the constant.
 *  3. **File names and directories are free.** `object ApiPaths` may live in
 *     `Constants.kt`, and a file's `package` need not match the directory it
 *     sits in, so a `<package>/<Name>.kt` PATH lookup is a convention and not a
 *     rule. The authority is each file's DECLARED `package`, which
 *     {@link extractKotlinModuleConstants} records and {@link resolveKotlinImport}
 *     requires an exact match on; the path is only a tie-break among files that
 *     already declare the right package.
 *  4. **Member imports are unmarked.** Java spells them `import static a.b.C.F`;
 *     Kotlin writes `import a.b.C.F`, which is byte-identical to a type import
 *     of a class `F` in package `a.b.C`. Nothing in the syntax says which, so
 *     the fold tries both readings (see `resolveImportedName`) instead of
 *     guessing from casing.
 *  5. **Any identifier may be backtick-quoted.** `` package com.example.`api` ``
 *     and `package com.example.api` are the SAME package to the compiler, and a
 *     keyword segment (`` com.example.`fun` ``) can only be spelled the quoted
 *     way. The grammar keeps the backticks in the node text, so every identifier is
 *     read through {@link unquoteKotlinIdentifier} before it becomes a map key
 *     or a lookup name — see that function for what a verbatim comparison cost.
 *
 * THREE PLACES THIS BINDING NO LONGER MIRRORS JAVA, each because the mirrored
 * behavior was wrong rather than merely different, and each open as a Java
 * follow-up rather than fixed here:
 *
 *  * `java-const-resolver.ts` flattens nested types into one file-level
 *    namespace and argues the collision away — "qualified refs carry the class
 *    name, so nesting only matters for same-name fields, which flatten
 *    last-wins". The argument does not hold: the collision is one level BELOW
 *    the qualification, in the initializer, so a fully qualified `A.ROUTE` whose
 *    initializer names a bare sibling `BASE` still resolves through whichever
 *    same-named sibling was walked last. {@link extractKotlinModuleConstants}
 *    keys by Kotlin's own visibility instead.
 *  * Java's import resolution can lean on the `<package>/<Name>.java` layout the
 *    language enforces. Kotlin's cannot, and inferring the package from the path
 *    lets a path-suffix twin outrank the real declaration — so
 *    {@link resolveKotlinImport} reads the declared `package` instead.
 *  * Java's fold entry points take a file and a name, because a Java `static
 *    final` reachable by simple name is reachable that way from anywhere in the
 *    file. A Kotlin COMPANION member is not: it is bound unqualified only inside
 *    its enclosing class body. {@link foldKotlinOperands} therefore also takes
 *    the enclosing type chain of the reference site, which is what lets the
 *    binding answer a bare reference by Kotlin's scoping rather than by "whoever
 *    was walked last" — see {@link qualifyKotlinRefInEnclosingTypes}.
 *
 * Constant shapes this binding harvests:
 *
 *   const val TOP_LEVEL = "/api/v1"          // file top level
 *   object ApiPaths {                        // object member
 *       const val BASE = "/api/v1"
 *       val ORDERS = BASE + "/orders"
 *   }
 *   class Holder { companion object { const val H = "/h" } }   // → Holder.H
 *
 * Reference shapes at annotation sites this binding resolves:
 *   @PostMapping(ApiPaths.ORDERS)                      // qualified
 *   @PostMapping(com.example.app.api.ApiPaths.ORDERS)  // FQN-qualified
 *   @PostMapping(ORDERS)                               // single-name import
 *   @PostMapping(ORDERS) after import com.example.api.* // package-star import
 *   @PostMapping(ApiPaths.BASE + "/orders")            // inline concat
 *
 * Which ANNOTATIONS count as routes is a separate question this module has no
 * say in — `spring-shared.ts` owns that map. Folding and annotation recognition
 * compose; neither implies the other.
 *
 * Keying (parity with the Java and Python bindings): the repo map is keyed by
 * unique POSIX file path, and an import that cannot be pinned to exactly one
 * file returns null (skip floor), never a wrong path. A missing route is a
 * missing fact; a wrongly folded one is a false edge in the graph. "Exactly one
 * file" is decided from the DECLARED package, not from the path: a path is a
 * repository-layout accident that any decoy directory can imitate, whereas the
 * `package` header is the declaration the compiler itself resolves against.
 *
 * POSIX keys are a PRECONDITION this module cannot check cheaply, so it is
 * enforced at the one boundary that produces them: `http-patterns/kotlin.ts`
 * normalizes separators on both the write side (the `prepareRepo` map keys) and
 * the read side (`scan`'s `fileRel`). It has to, because the orchestrator's file
 * list comes from glob v13, which has no `posix: true` and joins with the
 * platform separator — so on Windows the keys arrive backslashed and every
 * `<pkg>/<Name>.kt` test in {@link resolveKotlinImport} would miss, silently
 * disabling cross-file folding on that platform alone. Normalizing INSIDE this
 * module instead cannot work: the resolver returns the key it matched, and a
 * normalized return value would then miss in a map that was never normalized.
 *
 * WHERE THIS IS WIRED. Java reaches its binding from BOTH layers: the group
 * extractor (`group/extractors/http-patterns/java.ts`) and the ingestion
 * provider (`languages/java.ts`). Kotlin now does the same: the group extractor
 * (`group/extractors/http-patterns/kotlin.ts`) plus `languages/kotlin.ts`
 * (`extractDecoratorRoutes`, `extractModuleConstants`, `foldRoutePathOperands`).
 * The dedicated ingestion walker is `route-extractors/kotlin-spring.ts`; it
 * does not reuse Java `spring.ts`.

 *
 * Arms, all intended to be WIDER than the extractor (a gate may over-admit — it
 * only costs a parse — while rejecting a file the extractor would accept costs a
 * fact):
 *  - `const val NAME [: T] =`. `const` is legal only at a file's top level or in
 *    an `object`/`companion object`, i.e. exactly the carriers the extractor
 *    harvests, so this arm needs no scope check.
 *  - an `object` (or `companion object`) declaration together with a `val NAME =`
 *    binding. A non-`const` `val` is the other half of the extractor's input and
 *    carries no keyword of its own; requiring an `object` nearby keeps a file
 *    whose only `val`s are function locals from costing a parse. It still admits
 *    a top-level `val` in a file that happens to declare an object elsewhere,
 *    which is the harmless direction.
 *  - a `val NAME =` binding at file scope. A small lexical walk tracks braces
 *    and parentheses while skipping comments and literals, admitting the
 *    top-level non-`const` property the extractor harvests without turning every
 *    function-local `val` or constructor property into an extra parse.
 *
 * Both name arms accept a BACKTICK-QUOTED identifier as well as a bare one,
 * because the extractor does: `unquoteKotlinIdentifier` strips the quoting
 * everywhere a name becomes a key, so `const val \`ORDERS\` = "/orders"` is a
 * constant this module resolves. A gate that matched only `\w+` rejected the
 * file outright and the reference floored to skip — a gate narrower than the
 * extractor, which is the one direction the arms above are meant to exclude.

/**
 * Map a fully-qualified import specifier to the unique file key it refers to, or
 * null when it cannot be pinned to exactly one file.
 *
 * A specifier is split at its last dot into the package it names and the
 * declaration inside it (`com.example.app.api` + `ApiPaths`). Resolution then
 * runs in three steps, all of them "unique or nothing":
 *
 *  0. **Declared package** — only files whose `package` header is EXACTLY the
 *     sought package can carry the declaration (compared after
 *     {@link unquoteKotlinIdentifier}, since backtick quoting is spelling and
 *     not identity). This is the authority, and it
 *     is checked first. Kotlin does not require a file's directory to match its
 *     package, so the reverse test — "does this path end with the package?" —
 *     answers a different question, one any decoy directory can satisfy: a file
 *     at `src/x/com/example/api/ApiPaths.kt` declaring `package x.com.example.api`
 *     is not `com.example.api.ApiPaths` and must never be folded as it, and a
 *     path-suffix test also lets a root-level `package data` be impersonated by
 *     `…/com/example/data/`. An entry with no recorded package is rejected, not
 *     assumed to be the default package.
 *  1. **Declared name** — when exactly one file declares the sought name, use
 *     it. When two do, the FQN itself is duplicated in the repository and names
 *     no single declaration, so return null. This is the general form of the
 *     same-FQN check step 2 could only make for files that happen to follow the
 *     file-name convention, and it is what stops a `src/test/…` copy of a
 *     production constant from being folded into a production route.
 *  2. **File named after the declaration** — when declaration metadata found no
 *     owner, try the package-matching file ending
 *     `com/example/app/api/ApiPaths.kt`. Kotlin does not require this (`object
 *     ApiPaths` may live in `Constants.kt`), so it is only a fallback candidate;
 *     the subsequent map lookup must still prove that it carries the value.
 *  3. **Sole file in the package** — when declaration metadata cannot identify
 *     the name, use the unique package-matching candidate. The set passed in
 *     contains files with foldable or explicitly unfoldable declarations, so
 *     unrelated files cannot create ambiguity once step 1 identifies a unique
 *     declarer. With 2+ unidentified candidates it returns null.
 *
 * Steps 2 and 3 can still hand back a file that does not declare the wanted name
 * (its package is right and it is the only candidate, but the name lives
 * elsewhere or nowhere). That remains safe by construction: the fold looks the
 * name up in that file's map, misses, and returns null.
 *
 * A "nearest shared directory" tie-break is deliberately NOT applied when a step
 * has several candidates, for the reason the Java binding records: the JVM
 * resolves duplicate FQNs by classpath order, not directory proximity, so a test
 * fixture copy sitting closer in the tree can outrank the real dependency and
 * yield a silently wrong literal. In a resolver whose whole contract is
 * skip-or-correct, a plausible guess is the one answer that cannot be allowed.
 *
 * This can no longer be typed as the agnostic {@link ModuleConstants} consumer's
 * `ImportResolver`, whose signature carries only file KEYS: deciding a candidate
 * on its declared package needs the map those keys index. Nothing is lost — the
 * core's own fold is not used here either (see the module header), and the
 * alternative is a resolver that must guess from a path.

/**
 * Is `node` a Kotlin string literal, and if so what value does the route layer

 *
 * Two rejections, both floors rather than guesses:
 *  - **String templates.** `"$base/orders"` parses as a `string_literal` whose
 *    children include an interpolation alongside the `string_content` runs.
 *    Joining the content runs would silently DELETE the interpolated part and
 *    publish `/orders` — a path the application does not serve. Any named child
 *    that is not `string_content` means the value is not statically knowable, so
 *    the literal is refused. (The same test makes the function safe against a
 *    grammar that splits escape sequences into their own nodes: it would floor
 *    to skip, never to a de-escaped path.)
 *  - **Multi-line raw strings.** A single-line `"""/api"""` is exact — unlike a
 *    Java text block, a Kotlin raw string performs no escape processing and no
 *    incidental-indentation stripping, so it folds to precisely its content. A
 *    multi-line one carries newlines (and usually a `.trimIndent()` call this
 *    layer cannot fold), so it is refused.
 *
 * Otherwise the quotes are sliced off the RAW TEXT via
 * {@link unquoteSpringLiteral} — the same function the literal path uses — so

/**
 * Extract the declared package, file-level string constants, named imports and

 *
 * Constants come from the three carriers Kotlin allows a caller to reach without
 * an instance: file top level, `object` members, and `companion object` members.
 * A `val` in a plain class or interface body is per-instance or abstract and is
 * NOT collected — the Kotlin analogue of Java's `static final` requirement. `var`
 * is rejected outright.
 *
 * KEYS FOLLOW KOTLIN'S OWN VISIBILITY, not a flattened namespace. Every constant
 * is recorded under `<DeclaringType>.<NAME>`, the spelling a qualified reference
 * uses, with a companion member keyed under its ENCLOSING CLASS (`Holder.NAME`)
 * because that is how Kotlin source refers to it — `Companion` never appears in
 * a reference. The SIMPLE name is recorded only for a TOP-LEVEL `val`, the one
 * carrier whose bare binding really does span the file. A member of a named
 * `object` gets no bare key, because `BASE` alone does not name `A.BASE` from
 * anywhere outside `object A`'s own body. Writing one anyway (as this binding
 * and the Java one both used to) fabricates a binding the language does not
 * have, and a fabricated key outranks the genuine `import com.example.api.Paths.ORDERS`
 * that {@link computeKotlinFold} consults only after literals and expressions.
 *
 * A COMPANION member gets no bare key either: it is bound unqualified inside
 * its enclosing class body and nowhere else. {@link qualifyKotlinRefInEnclosingTypes}
 * rewrites a bare name to `<EnclosingType>.<NAME>` when an enclosing type
 * declares it, so the companion wins inside its own class and loses everywhere
 * else.
 *
 * An initializer that names a SIBLING is resolved the same way, against its own
 * scope chain, innermost first, before the file level: inside
 * `object A { const val BASE = "/right"; const val ROUTE = BASE + "/m" }` the
 * operand `BASE` is rewritten to `A.BASE`. Collecting every declaration before
 * recording any keeps that independent of declaration order.
 *
 * A TOP-LEVEL initializer has an EMPTY scope chain, so its bare operands stay
 * bare and resolve at file level — they must not pick up a companion key.
 *
 * A non-foldable rebind (`X = compute()`) DROPS X to unresolvable rather than
 * leaving a stale literal — and drops a same-named import with it whenever the
 * declaration shadows that import ANYWHERE (top level, or a companion inside its
 * class). The import map has no scopes, so a companion's shadow is applied
 * file-wide: the conservative direction, costing a route rather than publishing
 * the imported value at a reference the compiler binds to the unfoldable member.
 * An `object` member shadows nothing and must leave the import alone.
