/**
 * Language-agnostic string-constant folding for route-path resolution (#2391).
 *
 * Route decorators/annotations frequently build their path from a constant rather
 * than a string literal — `@router.post(API_V1_WIDGETS_GET)` (Python),
 * `@GetMapping(PathConstants.WIDGETS)` (Spring), and the Kotlin/C# equivalents are
 * the same shape. This module folds such a constant — or an inline
 * `+`-concatenation — to its literal value, following `+` operands and import
 * chains across a repo-wide, file-keyed constant map.
 *
 * The FOLD is language-neutral: it walks {@link Operand} lists and
 * {@link ModuleConstants} that ANY language's extractor can produce, and defers
 * the one language-specific decision — mapping an import specifier to the file it
 * refers to — to a caller-supplied {@link ImportResolver}. A language binding
 * (e.g. `python-const-resolver.ts`) provides that resolver plus a tree →
 * {@link ModuleConstants} extractor and, if wanted, thin pre-bound wrappers.
 *
 * This mirrors how `route-path.ts` (URL normalization) and `spring-shared.ts`
 * (annotation primitives) are shared across the ingestion and group layers and
 * across languages: the reusable core lives in one place; per-language semantics
 * plug in. It deliberately does NOT reuse `ScopeResolver` (which resolves symbol
 * IDENTITIES, not literal string VALUES) or the `--pdg` `REACHING_DEF` layer
 * (intra-procedural, function-local, def→use reachability — not module-level
 * cross-file value folding).
