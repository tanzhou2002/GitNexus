/**
 * Zig scope-resolution query (RFC #909 Ring 3).
 *
 * The grammar is vendored (`vendor/tree-sitter-zig`) and may be absent on a
 * platform without a prebuild, so the language module is required lazily and
 * `getZigParser` / `getZigScopeQuery` throw only when actually invoked without
 * the grammar installed. That is safe: the parse pipeline filters `.zig` files
 * through `parser-loader.isLanguageAvailable` before any scope extraction runs.
 *
 * Zig specifics encoded here:
 *   - Containers (struct/enum/union/opaque) are anonymous nodes bound by the
 *     enclosing `variable_declaration`; declarations capture the binding
 *     identifier from the wrapper.
 *   - `@import` is a builtin call, not import-statement syntax; the
 *     `#eq?` predicate keeps other builtins (@sizeOf, @as, …) out.
 *   - A plain `(variable_declaration (identifier))` rule would also match
 *     container and import bindings — `emitZigScopeCaptures` filters those
 *     groups out so a name binds exactly once.

;; identifier is TitleCase — see \`emitZigScopeCaptures\` (a value call
;; \`const t = util.makeThing()\` belongs to the call-return rules above and
