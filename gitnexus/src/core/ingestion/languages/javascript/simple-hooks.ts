/**
 * Simple hooks for the JavaScript scope-resolution provider.
 *
 * `jsBindingScopeFor` wraps `tsBindingScopeFor` and adds the JS-only
 * `@type-binding.class-field` hoisting rule.  The other two hooks
 * (`jsImportOwningScope`, `jsReceiverBinding`) are identical to their
 * TypeScript counterparts and are re-exported directly.
 *
 * ## Why class-field hoisting lives here (not in `tsBindingScopeFor`)
 *
 * `@type-binding.class-field` is emitted exclusively by
 * `synthesizeConstructorFieldBindings` in `captures.ts`, which is a
 * JavaScript-only synthesis pass.  TypeScript uses
 * `@type-binding.parameter-property` for constructor parameter
 * properties instead.  Keeping the JS-only rule in the JS hook file
 * prevents language-specific logic from leaking into shared TypeScript
 * infrastructure (DoD.md §2.2).

 * walk up from the Function (constructor) scope to the Class scope.
 * This puts `User.address → Address` in the class's typeBindings so
 * compound-receiver resolution finds it when resolving
