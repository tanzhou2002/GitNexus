/**
 * Real `tsconfig.json` loading for module resolution (#2953).
 *
 * The previous loader (`language-config.ts:loadTsconfigPaths`) was built to feed
 * a heuristic, and it shows: it reads three filenames at the repo ROOT only,
 * gives up unless `compilerOptions.paths` exists, keeps only `targets[0]` of
 * each mapping, and treats a pattern as a plain prefix. That is enough to make
 * a guess look plausible and not enough to resolve anything correctly:
 *
 *   - a monorepo has one tsconfig PER PACKAGE, and `apps/web/tsconfig.json` is
 *     what governs `apps/web/src/main.ts` — the root config governs nothing;
 *   - `extends` is how essentially every real config is written, and the
 *     `baseUrl` / `paths` almost always live in the extended base;
 *   - `baseUrl` alone (no `paths`) is a complete resolution rule on its own, and
 *     it is exactly the rule that makes `import 'src/utils/foo'` legal — the
 *     case the old suffix matcher was really standing in for;
 *   - `paths` maps a pattern to an ORDERED LIST of targets, tried in order.
 *
 * So this module answers the question TypeScript actually asks: for THIS file,
 * what are `baseUrl` and `paths`?
