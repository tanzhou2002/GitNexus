/**
 * Ruby's veto on the global-name fallback — see
 * `ScopeResolver.isGlobalNameFallbackPlausible`.
 *
 * Ruby keeps the labeled fallback deliberately: with autoload (Rails' zeitwerk,
 * `ActiveSupport::Dependencies`) a file genuinely can call a method whose
 * defining file it never requires, so "no require" is NOT evidence of
 * impossibility the way it is in Go or Rust.
 *
 * What IS decidable is namespacing — but only for CLASS bodies. A method
 * defined inside a `class` is not callable as a bare `helper()` from another
 * file unless that file names the class somehow (a receiver `Ns.helper`, a
 * subclass declaration, an `include`, a `require`). A method defined inside a
 * `module` body is different in kind: modules exist to be mixed in, and Rails
 * mixes them in for you — every `*Helper` module is included into views and
 * controllers by the framework, and concerns arrive through `included do`
 * hooks — so a bare `format_money()` in a view legitimately reaches
 * `module ApplicationHelper` with no `include`, `require`, or constant
 * anywhere in the caller. Refusing that would delete real edges on exactly the
 * codebase shape Ruby's fallback exists to serve. So module-owned methods stay
 * a LABELED guess, and the refusal targets CLASS-owned methods whose class the
 * caller never names. A top-level method (`ownerId === undefined`) is left
 * alone, since that is the shape autoload actually delivers. When the owner
 * cannot be found or typed (no `parsedFileOf`, owner outside the file set),
 * the question is unanswered and the edge is allowed.
 *
 * "Never names" is read from the caller's own text-visible signals — its
 * `require`/`include`/`extend` targets, and any reference site spelling the
 * namespace's constant. If any of them mentions the namespace, the call is
 * plausible and the labeled edge stands. `require` paths are snake_case
 * (`billing/invoice_service`) while constants are CamelCase
 * (`Billing::InvoiceService`), so the comparison normalizes both sides —
 * without that the `require` branch never matched anything.
 *
 * One more thing a caller file can do without naming the class: INHERIT its
 * way to it. `class UsersController < AdminController` reaches every method
 * `ApplicationController` defines while naming only `AdminController`, and an
 * `include Concern` reaches whatever that concern includes in turn. Neither
 * chain is decidable from one file, so a caller with ANY inheritance or mixin
 * surface (an `inherits` site, an `include`/`extend`/`prepend` marker) is
 * treated as plausible. So is a caller file that DEFINES a module: a module's
 * methods run against whatever class includes the module, and call that class's
 * methods bare — `module PostGuardian; def can_see?; is_staff? ...` reaches
 * `class Guardian#is_staff?` because Guardian includes PostGuardian, a fact the
 * module file never states. What remains refused is the shape Ruby itself
 * rejects: a bare call to a class's method from a file that inherits nothing,
 * mixes in nothing, defines no module, and never spells the class. Measured on
 * discourse@3f71fa15c that is ~1000 refusals, and the sample is what the rule
 * promises: RSpec `before`/`after`/`subject` guessed to serializer methods of
 * the same name, `Gemfile`'s `gem` to `Plugin::Instance#gem`, `routes.rb`'s
 * `get` to `Draft#get` — fabricated callers, every one.
