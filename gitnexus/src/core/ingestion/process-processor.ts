 * could tell. A silently truncating cap reads as "this is everything", which is
 * the same class of confident-empty answer the rest of this work is about.
 * `dispatchFanoutSkipped` / `propertyDispatch.skippedKeys` are the precedent.
 *
 * The counters are kept SEPARATE rather than summed because they mean different
 * things and a reader acts on them differently: unexplored entry points mean
 * whole flows are missing, while a depth-capped trace means a flow is present
 * but shorter than it really is. `truncated` is the single boolean to branch on.
 * That distinction is not decoration — `pipeline-phases/processes.ts` uses it to
 * decide which of these are worth a `warn` and which belong at `debug`.
 *
 * `entryPointCandidatesDropped` was MISSED on the first pass, which is worth
 * recording because the comment deriving `truncated` claimed "a new ceiling
 * added later cannot be forgotten here" while an EXISTING one already had been:
 * `findEntryPoints` ranks every scoring candidate and then keeps 200, so
 * `entryPointsUnexplored` — computed over the list it RETURNS — could only ever
 * see the survivors. On any repository with more than 200 candidate entry

  // Ranking was `sort by length` alone, and the top of that list was one
  // behaviour described many ways: measured on the reporting repo, eleven of
  // the top fourteen processes were four entry points crossed with three
  // terminals of the same date-window utility cluster — `Handle ->
  // AlignWindowEnd`, `Main -> AlignWindowStart`, `ProcessSymbol ->
  // ResolveGridIntervalMs`. Genuine call chains, but a reader learns one thing
  // from fourteen entries.
  //
  // Keyed on the TERMINAL, not the entry point. Keying on the entry was tried
  // first and made it worse — many files declare a `main`, so each was a
  // distinct entry that round-robin then awarded its own slot, and
  // `Main -> AlignWindowEnd` went from one row to eight. The repetition was
  // never in where a flow starts; it is in where flows pile up.
  //
  // Depth still orders within a terminal and still leads the list, since
  // insertion order here is deepest-first. What changes is that no terminal
  // takes a second slot until every other has had a first. Measured: distinct
  // terminals in the top 20 went 3 -> 20, and the repo's own domain flows
  // (`ReconcilePositions -> ...`) moved into the top 4%.
  //
  // What this does NOT do, recorded so it does not read as settled: the
  // reported cause — ranking rewarding fan-in, promoting chains ending in
  // widely-called helpers — measured FALSE. Those terminals have one caller
  // each (`alignWindowStart` 1, `validateSymbol` 1). A fan-in discount was
  // implemented against that hypothesis and moved nothing.
  //
  // R3-6 adds one rule ahead of depth: a SINK-terminated trace outranks a
  // leaf-terminated one. A flow that ends where the program does something —
  // places an order, writes a row — is what a reader came for; a chain that
  // ends in a date helper is where control happened to stop. Depth still orders
  // within each group.
  //
  // This is what closed the gap that used to be described here as out of reach:
  // a business flow could not be a process in its own right, because the walk
  // emitted only at a leaf, at max depth, or on a cycle, so a flow whose
  // meaningful endpoint calls onward survived only as whatever leaf it bottomed
  // out in. Ranking could never fix it — the flow was not a candidate to rank.
  // It is bounded honestly rather than fully closed: sinks are exactly where
  // fetch/ORM extraction fires (see `buildSinkFunctionSet`), so a codebase whose
  // outward calls are not detected as such still sees leaf-terminated traces
  // only.
  // DETERMINISM. The comparator below ranks by sink-ness then by depth, and for
  // two flows equal on both it returned 0. `Array.prototype.sort` is stable, so
  // a 0 preserves INPUT order — which traces back to `graph.iterNodes()`, i.e.
  // the order files happened to be inserted. Under `maxProcesses` capping that
  // decided which `Process` and `STEP_IN_PROCESS` nodes were persisted at all.
  //
  // Reproduced: two equal three-step flows with `maxProcesses: 1` select
  // `handleAlpha`; inserting the identical nodes and CALLS edges in reverse
  // select `handleBeta`. Same repository, same commit, different persisted
  // graph — so an incremental run that reorders assembly, or a filesystem that
  // enumerates differently, silently changes what the tool reports.
  //
  // The id is the tiebreak because it is the only totally-ordered, content-derived
  // key available here; comparing the whole path keeps it stable when two traces
  // share a terminal.
  //
  // MUTATION STATUS, recorded so nobody mistakes this for a verified guard:
  // removing THIS tiebreak alone fails nothing, because the two dedup sorts
  // below already impose a total order on the list that reaches here. The
  // entry-point sort and the dedup sorts each ARE individually verified. This
  // one is kept as defence in depth — it cannot misbehave (it only makes an
  // already-deterministic order explicit) and it is what stops a future change
  // to dedup ordering from silently re-opening the defect.
  //
  // Decorated once and sorted on the precomputed key rather than joining inside
  // the comparator — see `traceOrderKey` for why the key exists at all and
  // `sortByDepthThenPath` for why it is built exactly once per trace. The sink
  // test is hoisted for the same reason: it ran twice per comparison.
