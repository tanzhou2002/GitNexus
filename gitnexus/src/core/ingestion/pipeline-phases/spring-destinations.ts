/**
 * Phase: springDestinations
 *
 * Materializes Spring async messaging as graph structure: a `Destination` node
 * per broker address, `CONSUMES_FROM` from every `@KafkaListener`-family
 * handler, and `PUBLISHES_TO` from every messaging-template publish. The
 * inbound and outbound facts are captured during parse and survive the parse
 * cache; until now nothing read them.
 *
 * Since `asyncApiSpecPath`, the phase has a SECOND source that is not Spring
 * and not source code at all: AsyncAPI documents read off disk
 * (`ingestion/asyncapi/document.ts`). They mint the same `Destination` nodes on
 * the same key, so both sources meet on one node. The reader is deliberately
 * framework-neutral and lives outside `frameworks/spring/`; only the emit is
 * hosted here, because this is where the node's keying rule is enforced and
 * splitting that rule across two phases is how it drifts. The phase name is
 * accurate about its origin rather than its current contents.
 *
 * Shaped after `Route` + `HANDLES_ROUTE` in `routes.ts` — a framework overlay
 * node keyed by what it names, with the callable pointing at it, down to the
 * detail that the key pairs the address with the one dimension that can make
 * two same-named things different places: the method for a Route, the broker
 * here.
 *
 * ── THE KEYING RULE, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THE PHASE ─────────────────────
 *
 * A `Destination` connects two services precisely because both sides mint the
 * SAME node id from the SAME address on the SAME broker. That is the whole
 * value, and it is also the whole hazard: an address that could not be resolved
 * must never be allowed to key a node.
 *
 *     resolved    id = generateId('Destination', `<broker> <address>`)  `address` present
 *     unresolved  id = generateId('Destination', <site>)                `address` ABSENT
 *
 * Two unrelated services that each merely write `@KafkaListener(topics =
 * "${app.topic}")` have said nothing whatever about each other. Keyed on the
 * placeholder text they would land on one node and READ AS CONNECTED, in a
 * report, as a fact. A missing edge is visible as a gap; a false one is not.
 *
 * A status property would not have prevented this, and neither would a second
 * label: the id is what merges the nodes, and both sides would still compute
 * the same id. Only the KEY prevents it, so an unresolved destination is keyed
 * by its source LOCATION — a value no second file can produce.
 *
 * The same rule governs the `address` PROPERTY, which is the join key a
 * cross-repository pass would match on. It is written only when resolved. An
 * absent property cannot match another absent property, so the structural
 * guarantee survives being read back out of the database. The unresolved
 * spelling is kept in `name`, for a human reading the node.
 *
 * The BROKER is part of the connecting key rather than a reason to withdraw
 * one — see {@link destinationNodeKey}, which owns that argument and the
 * evidence for it. Two brokers claiming one address is therefore an ordinary
 * two-node situation here, exactly like `GET /x` and `POST /x`, and this phase
 * needs no vocabulary for it: nothing is being taken away, so there is nothing
 * to diagnose.
 *
 * `name` must never be used to join two destinations, and nothing does — but
 * the stronger claim that nothing reads it at all would be false. `Destination`
 * is in `VALID_NODE_LABELS`, and `mcp/local/local-backend.ts` resolves a
 * symbol with an unlabeled `WHERE n.name = $symName`, so a destination can be
 * returned by name like any other node. That is a lookup, not a join: it
 * matches a caller-supplied string against one node, never one destination
 * against another, so it cannot manufacture the connection this phase exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * @deps    parse, scopeResolution, springConfig
 * @reads   Spring messaging capture facts, Method/Function nodes, Property nodes,
 *          AsyncAPI documents under `options.asyncApiSpecPath` (filesystem)
 * @writes  Destination nodes; synthetic File nodes for out-of-tree documents;
 *          CONSUMES_FROM / PUBLISHES_TO / USES edges

/**
 * Mint destinations stated by AsyncAPI documents, with no claim about code.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS DOES NOT TRY TO FIND THE HANDLER ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * A document says an address is sent to or received from; it does not say by
 * which method. Guessing that mapping is a real temptation and a bad trade: the
 * addresses in one document partition by (broker, action) into buckets that
 * usually hold more than one operation, so any assignment beyond a bucket of
 * size one is a heuristic — and a wrong one silently attaches a real address to
 * the wrong handler, which is a false connection dressed as a resolved one.
 *
 * So this claims only what the document actually states: that THIS SERVICE
 * talks to that address on that broker in that direction. The edge therefore
 * starts at the document, not at a callable. That is a weaker statement than a
 * source-derived edge and it is worth having anyway, because it is available in
 * cases where the source cannot supply one at all — a listener registered
 * programmatically, a broker this codebase has no patterns for, or a language
 * whose messaging idiom nobody has taught it yet.
 *
 * The node itself is the ordinary resolved `Destination`: same key, same
 * `address` property, so a document and a source site that name one address on
 * one broker land on ONE node and the two halves of a conversation meet. That
 * is the whole point, and it is why this mints nothing of its own invention.
