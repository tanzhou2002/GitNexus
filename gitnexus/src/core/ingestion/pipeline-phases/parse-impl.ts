/**
 * Parse implementation — chunked parse + resolve loop.
 *
 * This is the core parsing engine of the ingestion pipeline. It reads
 * source files in stable hash-bucket packs (~2MB each by default), parses via the worker
 * pool (the sole parse path — there is no sequential fallback), and emits
 * route CALLS edges. Import,
 * call, and inheritance resolution are owned by the scope-resolution
 * phase, not here (RING4-1 #942 removed the legacy call DAG; RING4-2 #943
 * removed the legacy per-file import resolution + wildcard synthesis).
 *
 * Consumed by the parse phase (`parse.ts`) — the phase file handles
 * dependency wiring while the heavy implementation lives here.

 * Heap-scale guardrail constants (#2649). Measured on a Linux-kernel analyze:
 * ~75 graph nodes per PARSEABLE file (~5M nodes / ~65k parseable files;
 * validated against heap probes at chunks 25/50/75 of 113 — the first
 * calibration divided by total scanned files and under-projected by ~30%),
 * main-thread heap per node. C-heavy corpus; other language mixes vary — these
 * feed a WARNING and an emergency abort, never a hard admission gate, so
 * estimate error only shifts when the operator hears about the problem, not
 * whether analyze runs.
 *
 * RECALIBRATED for streamed structural emit (#2680), which is on by default for
 * full rebuilds and holds relationships out of the JS heap. The original 2250
 * was measured against the object-based graph; an A/B at 400k nodes / 1.08M
 * edges put streaming at 1.40x smaller (819 MB -> 584 MB), so the corpus-
 * calibrated figure is divided by that ratio: 2250 / 1.40 ~= 1600. Scaling the
 * measured constant rather than substituting a synthetic one keeps #2649's
 * kernel calibration intact and changes only the one thing that actually moved.
 *
 * If streaming is disabled (GITNEXUS_STREAM_GRAPH_EMIT=0, or any non-force run)
 * this UNDER-projects by ~40%, so the preflight warning may stay quiet on a repo
 * that then struggles. That is the safe direction to be wrong in: the abort
 * below reads LIVE heap use, not this projection, so it still catches the real

    //    has committed, so dispatching one cache pack at a time strands the
    //    pool whenever a pack is smaller than it — which stable packs usually
    //    are. Chunks accumulate into a ROUND (bounded by `roundByteBudget` of
    //    cache-missing source) and go out in one `dispatchGroups` call.
    // 2. Serial merge. Merging worker results into the graph is the only
    //    remaining serial main-thread step (ParsedFile serialization now runs
    //    in workers). A dispatched round is parked in `pendingRound` and
    //    merged only AFTER the following round's dispatch has started, so the
    //    workers parse round N+1 while the main thread merges round N.
    //
    // Chunk ORDER is preserved throughout — rounds drain in order and entries
    // inside a round finalize by `chunkIdx` — which keeps deferred aggregation
    // deterministic regardless of how chunks were batched. Cache hits ride
    // along as round entries so they observe the same ordering without forcing
    // a dispatch.
