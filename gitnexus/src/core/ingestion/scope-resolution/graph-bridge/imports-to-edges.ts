/**
 * File→File IMPORTS edge emission from a finalized `ImportEdge` map.
 *
 * Deduplicates by `(sourceFile, targetFile)` so multi-symbol imports
 * from the same module collapse to a single edge — matching the
 * legacy schema.
 *
 * Next-consumer contract: language-agnostic. Any provider with a
 * scope-resolution ImportEdge stream emits File→File edges via this
 * single function. The `reason` defaults to
 * `'scope-resolution: import'`; provider may override if downstream
 * filters on reason.
 *
 * ## Non-initializing imports carry a distinct `reason`
 *
 * A pair reached ONLY by imports that cannot run at module-initialization time
 * still gets an edge — it is a real dependency, and impact/trace must see it —
 * but it cannot participate in the kind of cycle `check --cycles` exists to
 * find. There are two such kinds, and they are NOT the same fact:
 *
 *  - **deferred** — the import exists at runtime, just later. `import('./m')`
 *    and a function-local `import` both really load the module; what they do
 *    not do is load it while the importing module is still initializing.
 *    Deferring is in fact the standard idiom for BREAKING an init cycle, and
 *    this repository uses it that way on purpose in both spellings:
 *    `core/group/service.ts` does `await import('./cross-impact.js')`, and
 *    `eval/workflow_bench/proposer_sandbox.py` puts a plain `import` inside a
 *    function under the comment "Kept lazy to avoid a module cycle".
 *  - **type-only** — the import does not exist at runtime AT ALL. `tsc` deletes
 *    `import type { X } from './m'`; the emitted JavaScript contains no
 *    reference to `./m`. Nothing was made later; the dependency is compile-time
 *    only. Eight of the ten false cycles this repository reports are this.
 *
 * Reporting either as an init cycle flags the fix as the bug. They get separate
 * suffixes rather than one shared "not really an import" tag because the two
 * answers to "does this edge exist when the program runs?" are opposite, and a
 * reader of the graph — or the next filter written against `reason` — needs to
 * be able to tell them apart.
 *
 * Three signals, because no one of them covers the others. All three ride the
 * EDGE — this function reads properties and never walks the scope tree for
 * them, for the reason spelled out under "Why nothing here is derived from the
 * scope tree" below:
 *
 *  - `ImportEdge.kind === 'dynamic-resolved'` — TS/JS `import()`.
 *  - `ImportEdge.runsOnlyWhenCalled` — the import sits inside a function body
 *    AND this language's imports execute where they are written: Python's
 *    `def f(): from x import Y`, Ruby's `def f; require 'x'; end`, a CommonJS
 *    `require()` in a body. Nothing marks those as dynamic, because
 *    syntactically they are ordinary imports; what defers them is WHERE they
 *    sit, so `scope-extractor.ts` decides it in Pass 3 and it is carried down
 *    — `ParsedImport` → `finalize-algorithm.ts` → the edge. A language whose
 *    imports do not execute never gets the tag no matter where one sits (Rust
 *    `use`, C/C++ `#include`; see
 *    `LanguageProvider.importsExecuteWhereWritten`).
 *  - `ImportEdge.typeOnly` — TypeScript `import type` / `import { type X }`.
 *    Neither of the other two sees it: the kind is the ordinary `named` /
 *    `alias`, and the statement sits at module top level like any other. Only
 *    the `type` keyword says it, so it is carried from the syntax down —
 *    `typescript/import-decomposer.ts` → `interpret.ts` → `finalize-algorithm.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why nothing here is derived from the scope tree
 *
 * `scopeTree` is used for exactly one thing: turning the map's key into the
 * source `filePath`. It is NOT a place to ask where an import was written.
 * `finalize-algorithm.ts:295` publishes every file's finalized edges as
 * `linkedByScope.set(file.moduleScope, …)`, so the `imports` map this function
 * receives holds one bucket per FILE, keyed by that file's `Module` scope —
 * never by the scope an import was actually written in. A walk from such a key
 * looking for an enclosing `Function` starts at a `Module` and answers `false`
 * every time, for every import in the tree.
 *
 * That walk was here, and it never fired once. It looked correct in unit tests
 * only because they hand-built `new Map([['fn', …]])`, a shape the pipeline
 * cannot produce. Position now arrives as `runsOnlyWhenCalled`, decided where
 * the position is still known.
 *
 * Tagging the reason is enough for the check query, which already filters
 * non-runtime edges that way (`markdown-link`, Swift implicit module
 * visibility) — no change to the persisted RELATION schema, no new property on
 * the emitted `CodeRelation`. (`typeOnly` and `runsOnlyWhenCalled` are fields
 * on the in-memory `ImportEdge`, which is never persisted; they end here.)
 *
 * ponytail: reason-string tagging rather than a typed relation property,
 * because the one consumer already filters on `reason` and a property would
 * touch the relation schema. If a second consumer ever needs to branch on this,
 * promote it to a real field then.
 *
 * ## Precedence: the strongest runtime presence in a pair wins
 *
 * Emission dedupes by `(sourceFile, targetFile)`, so one edge has to speak for
 * every import that reaches the pair. Rank them by how much of the dependency
 * survives to run time — initializing > deferred > erased — and let the
 * strongest win: the ranks ascend as presence weakens, so the pair keeps the
 * LOWEST rank it sees ({@link PRESENCE_INITIALIZES} is 0). Inverting that
 * comparison is the one mutation here that hides a real cycle rather than
 * inventing a false one, which is why the suite pins it directly.
 *
 *  - Any initializing import wins outright. One top-level `import { f }` beside
 *    an `await import()` and a dozen `import type`s is a real init dependency;
 *    reporting the pair as deferred or erased would HIDE a true cycle.
 *  - Deferred beats type-only. A pair with a function-local import plus some
 *    `import type`s does load the target at run time, so `(deferred)` is the
 *    honest label; `(type-only)` would claim the module never loads.
 *  - The two deferred signals rank the same. `import()` and a function-local
 *    import are the same claim about the emitted program — it loads, later —
 *    so a pair reached only by them is `(deferred)` either way.
 *
 * That also settles the mixed statement `import { type X, Y } from './m'`
 * without the decomposer aggregating anything: `X` is erased, `Y` is not, and
 * `Y` carries the pair. A statement is type-only exactly when every specifier
 * it decomposes to is.
 *
 * Pairs are collected before anything is emitted so the ranking sees every
 * contributing edge rather than whichever one arrived first. Insertion order
 * into the map is first-seen order, so emission order is byte-identical to the
 * single-pass form this replaced.
