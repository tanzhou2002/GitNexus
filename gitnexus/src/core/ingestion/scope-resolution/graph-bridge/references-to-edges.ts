/**
 * Translate the resolved `ReferenceIndex` into legacy graph edges.

 * Per reference:
 *   1. Resolve `fromScope` → caller graph-node id by walking the scope
 *      chain looking for an enclosing Function/Method/Class.
 *   2. Resolve `toDef` → target graph-node id via `nodeLookup`.
 *   3. Emit the edge (`CALLS` / `READS` / `WRITES` / `EXTENDS` / `USES`)
 *      with the standard reason format (`referenceEdgeReason`).
 *
 * Skips (without throwing) when either side fails to map — either side
 * may legitimately not exist as a graph node (e.g. a resolved target
 * lives in an external file that wasn't ingested into the graph).
 *
 * Next-consumer contract: this function is the canonical bridge from
 * a shared `ReferenceIndex` into per-language graph edges. Every
 * registry-primary language provider calls this exactly once with its
 * `referenceIndex` output and its own `nodeLookup`.
