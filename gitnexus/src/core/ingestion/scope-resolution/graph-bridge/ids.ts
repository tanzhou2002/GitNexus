/**
 * Scope-resolution → legacy graph-node ID bridging.
 *
 * Two functions:
 *   - `resolveDefGraphId` — turn a scope-resolution `SymbolDefinition`
 *     into the graph's node id for the corresponding legacy node.
 *   - `resolveCallerGraphId` — walk a scope chain from a reference
 *     site upward to find the enclosing function/method/class and
 *     return its graph-node id. Falls back to the File node for
 *     module-level calls so those still get an edge source.
 *
 * Next-consumer contract: language-agnostic. Any OO language with
 * file-level module semantics (TypeScript, Java, Go, Kotlin) can
 * reuse `resolveCallerGraphId` as-is. Languages with different
 * top-level semantics (COBOL programs, Rust crate modules) may want
 * a different file-level fallback — cross that bridge when they
 * migrate.
