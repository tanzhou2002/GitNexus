/**
 * Graph edge emission primitives.
 *
 * Two functions:
 *   - `mapReferenceKindToEdgeType` — translate a scope-resolution
 *     `Reference.kind` into the corresponding graph edge type.
 *   - `tryEmitEdge` — given a reference site + target def, resolve
 *     caller + target to graph ids and emit the edge with
 *     language-provided reason text, dedup-keyed by
 *     `(edgeType, callerId, targetId, line, col)`.
 *
 * Next-consumer contract: any language provider can call `tryEmitEdge`
 * from its own post-pass to emit edges it resolves Python-specific
 * (or TypeScript-specific, etc.) logic. The dedup key is
 * language-agnostic — no language needs to change it.

/**
 * Is this read site a PHANTOM — a duplicate of the call happening beside it?
 *
 * Some languages' member-read capture also matches the callee of a member call,
 * so `obj.f()` produces a `call` site on `f` AND a `read` site on `obj.f` at the
 * same position (Go's `@reference.read` matches every `selector_expression`).
 * The capture layer marks that second site `inCalleePosition` rather than
 * dropping it, because the two cases it covers are indistinguishable there:
 *
 *   - tail resolves to a METHOD → phantom. The ACCESSES edge duplicates the
 *     CALLS edge emitted for the same source position; suppress it.
 *   - tail resolves to a FIELD  → genuine. `h.dep.Work()` where
 *     `Work func() error` reads a func-typed struct field and calls the value
 *     it holds. That read is the field's only ACCESSES evidence — keep it.
 *
 * Only the resolved target's kind separates them, which is why this decision
 * lives at emission and not in any language's capture code. Sites without the
 * marker are untouched, so a genuine method VALUE (`f := obj.method`) — never in
 * callee position — keeps its read.
 *
 * "Invoked rather than read" is `CALL_TARGET_TYPES` — the canonical callable
 * target set (`FREE_CALLABLE_TYPES` ∪ Method/Constructor), not a local copy. A
 * hand-rolled `{Function, Method, Constructor}` silently omits `Macro` (C/C++)
 * and `Delegate` (C#), the two labels that set exists to add, and drops the
 * `satisfies` guard in `symbol-table.ts` that compile-enforces every free
 * callable label against `LABEL_BEHAVIOR`.

/**

 * the picked owner-indexed method def carries no `qualifiedName` (object
 * literals have no class owner to seed it) and therefore cannot
 * round-trip through `resolveDefGraphId`. The def's `nodeId` IS the
 * canonical graph node id (written by the parse phase), so the caller
 * passes it directly.
 *
 * All other invariants of `tryEmitEdge` apply: dedup key shape, collapse
 * flag honoring, edge-type mapping, caller-id resolution.
 *
 * ONE deliberate exception: the {@link isPhantomCalleeRead} suppression is not
 * applied here, because it keys on the target's node label and this entry point
 * is handed an id rather than a def. Reachable only for a `read` site marked
 * `inCalleePosition` whose receiver typed as an object-literal VALUE — a
 * JS/TS-shaped registration. No language that sets the marker resolves through
 * this bridge today (verified for Go, whose func-valued struct-literal fields
 * resolve through the owned-member path instead). A language adding the marker
 * must re-check this path.
