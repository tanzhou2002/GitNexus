 * Per-language census of global-name fallback decisions: how many call sites

 * Sites are counted before edge coalescing: a precisely bound site can prove
 * the same caller/target dependency, so this is not a count of heuristic edges.
 *
 * Both halves are needed and neither is meaningful alone. A guess count with no
 * refusal count cannot distinguish a language with genuinely few impossible
 * candidates from one whose hook is missing; a refusal count with no guess count
 * cannot distinguish a working guard from one that rejects everything. The pair
 * is what makes the guard auditable on a real repository, which is the whole
 * point of recording it — before this, guessed edges were emitted with the same
 * reason and confidence as import-resolved ones and the number was unknowable.
 *
 * Structural sibling of `unresolved-receivers.ts`'s summary, and persisted the
 * same way (`RepoMeta.nameFallbackEdges`).
