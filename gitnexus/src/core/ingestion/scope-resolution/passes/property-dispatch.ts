/**
 * `emitPropertyDispatchCalls` — value-ref registration edges + field-based
 * dispatch for functions registered as object-literal property values
 * (#2437).
 *
 * A provider-hook registration (`{ emitScopeCaptures: emitCppScopeCaptures }`)
 * emits a USES reference edge — a registration is not an invocation (Kythe
 * `ref` vs `ref/call`; Joern `METHOD_REF`). The invocation happens later
 * through the property (`provider.emitScopeCaptures(...)`) — a dispatch the
 * receiver-bound pass cannot resolve because object literals are not
 * IMPLEMENTS-linked implementors. This pass closes that soundness gap the
 * field-based way (Feldthaus et al., ICSE'13; CodeQL `impliedReceiverStep`):
 * key registrations by property name and connect every member-call site
 * `x.<key>(...)` to every function registered under `<key>`.
 *
 * This pass is the SINGLE owner of `value-ref` resolution. The shared
 * registries only consult pre-finalize local bindings — imported names live
 * in finalized bindings (the same reason free calls need
 * `emitFreeCallFallback`) — so `resolveReferenceSites` skips `value-ref`
 * sites and this pass resolves them post-finalize (see
 * `resolveValueRefTarget` — Function/Method/Constructor only, the callable
 * gate that keeps `{ port: DEFAULT_PORT }` from emitting anything, and
 * receiver-aware so a qualified reference binds the owner it was written
 * with).
 *
 * Precision posture (mirrors `emitInterfaceDispatchFor`):
 *   - reason `'property-dispatch'` keeps synthesized CALLS auditable;
 *   - dispatch confidence 0.7 sits below the 0.85 resolved baseline;
 *   - a per-key fan-out cap drops promiscuous names (`handler`, `callback`)
 *     entirely rather than truncating silently — property-name collisions
 *     across unrelated objects are the documented field-based failure mode.
 *
 * Ordering: runs AFTER the precise emit passes. `graph.addRelationship` is
 * first-write-wins on the position-keyed edge id, so a site that already
 * resolved precisely to the same target keeps its precise edge.
 *
 * Language-neutral: consumes only `value-ref` sites (any language that
 * emits the capture participates) and generic member-call sites.

/**
 * Resolve a `value-ref` site to the callable it names.
 *
 * Two shapes, and the difference matters:
 *
 *   - BARE (`{ handler: onClick }`, `register(onTick)`) — the name is resolved
 *     up the lexical chain, which is what an unqualified name means. Be exact
 *     about what that walk does, because it is not a plain lexical lookup:
 *     `findCallableBindingInScope` applies the callable predicate WHILE walking,
 *     so a scope binding the name to a parameter or a local contributes nothing
 *     and the walk continues outward. A nearer non-callable binding is stepped
 *     over — the same shape the qualified path guards against below, unguarded
 *     here. Pre-existing (#2437) and out of scope for #3399; reachable in JS/TS
 *     (`function outer(handler) { return { h: handler }; }` beside a top-level
 *     `function handler`), and narrow in Zig, which rejects a local shadowing a
 *     container declaration.
 *
 *   - QUALIFIED (`bridge.accessor(Element.getNamespaceUri, …)`) — the source
 *     WROTE the owner, so the lexical chain is the wrong instrument. It gives
 *     local bindings precedence (`walkScopeChain`), so a nested container
 *     holding its own `getNamespaceUri` answers first and the registration is
 *     attached to a DIFFERENT function than the one written. That is a wrong
 *     edge, not a missing one — strictly worse for a tool whose value is that
 *     its edges can be trusted — and it is reachable in any language that
 *     allows a same-named callable in a nested container, Zig included.
 *
 * So a qualified site resolves through its receiver: name the owner, then take
 * the member off that owner. An owner is either a MODULE or a CLASS-like
 * container — `utils.compare` and `Element.getNamespaceUri` are the same shape
 * written against the two kinds of namespace a language has, and the member-call
 * path already resolves both (receiver-bound-calls Case 1 / Case 2). Both are
 * tried here, MODULE FIRST: see `findNamespaceValueRefTarget` for why a module
 * receiver cannot simply be declined, and the comment on the call below for why
 * the container channel must not go first.
 *
 * If neither channel names the owner, or the owner is named but owns no such
 * callable, this DECLINES rather than falling back to the lexical walk.
 *
 * Be precise about what declining costs, because it is more than one reference:
 * a site that emits NO edge leaves no evidence for `impact`'s value-reference
 * probe to read, so the target keeps `epistemic: "exact"` — silence, not a
 * hedge. That is why the module channel above exists rather than being waved
 * through as "just a decline". What remains declined is the case where the
 * written receiver names nothing this index knows at all (a Zig `@This()` alias
 * whose name differs from its container's, an owner from outside the workspace):
 * there the alternative is not a hedge either, it is a confident edge to a
 * lexically-nearer function that the source did not name, and a wrong edge is
 * strictly worse than a missing one for a tool whose value is that its edges can
 * be trusted.
 *
 * `CALL_TARGET_TYPES`, not a hand-rolled label set: `findOwnedMember` also
 * answers with FIELDS, and a field named like the member would otherwise
 * register as if it were the callable.
 *
 * Exported for `bench/value-ref-resolution/measure.mjs`, which gates both the
 * resolved-target SET and the per-site cost of the four channels above across a
 * 4x file-count step. It is the per-site half of the pass, so timing it in
 * isolation is what makes a workspace-size dependency visible; timing
 * `emitPropertyDispatchCalls` would fold that signal into edge emission, and
 * re-implementing the channel order in the bench would pin the bench's idea of
 * this function rather than this function.

/**
 * The second kind of owner: a namespace handle.
 *
 * `const utils = @import("utils.zig"); register(utils.compare);` — `utils` is a
 * MODULE, not a class, so `findClassBindingInScope` answers nothing and the
 * class path above declines. Declining here would be a silent hole rather than
 * a conservative one: no USES edge is emitted, so
 * `callableValueReferenceBoundaries` measures a real zero and `impact` on
 * `compare` republishes `exact` — the very claim this feature exists to stop
 * making. Nothing downstream can hedge on evidence that was never recorded.
 *
 * So resolve it, through the SAME channel the member-CALL path already trusts
 * for `utils.compare()` (receiver-bound-calls Case 1): the file's namespace
 * import edges name the target module, and the target module's own local
 * module-scope bindings name its members. `utils.compare` and `utils.compare()`
 * disagreeing about what `utils` is would be the anomaly.
 *
 * The same three guards Case 1 applies, for the same reasons:
 *   - a LOCAL declaration shadowing the handle suppresses the resolution
 *     (`isNamespaceNameShadowed`) — `fn f(utils: Decoy) { register(utils.compare) }`
 *     names the parameter's member, and resolving through the import would be a
 *     wrong edge rather than a missing one;
 *   - a locally declared member wins, and a name the target file merely IMPORTED
 *     counts only when the provider says its imports ARE its exports
 *     (`ScopeResolver.namespaceExportsIncludeImportedNames`). That opt-in is not
 *     a detail to skip: a Zig HUB — a file made only of re-exports, ghostty's
 *     `src/terminal/`, tigerbeetle's `stdx` — declares nothing, so requiring a
 *     local declaration declines every member reached through one. `hub.fn()`
 *     resolves and `register(hub.fn)` would not, and one name would mean two
 *     things depending on whether a `(` followed it. In languages that do not
 *     opt in, a module's imports are not its exports and this stays closed;
 *   - two distinct defs under one name resolve NOTHING. Never guess a namespace
 *     member — the whole point of reading the written receiver is precision.
 *
 * `CALL_TARGET_TYPES` gates the answer for the same reason the class path needs
 * it: `utils.DEFAULT_PORT` is a module-scope binding too, and a registration
 * table full of constants must keep emitting nothing.
