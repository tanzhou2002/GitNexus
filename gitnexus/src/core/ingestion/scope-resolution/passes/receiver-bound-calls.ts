/**
 * Receiver-bound CALLS / ACCESSES emit pass — generic 8-case
 * dispatcher consuming `ScopeResolver` for the language-specific bits
 * (super recognizer, field-fallback toggle).
 *
 * **Contract Invariant I4 — case order is load-bearing.** The cases
 * are evaluated in this order; the FIRST that emits an edge wins:
 *
 *   1. **super branch** — `provider.isSuperReceiver(receiverName)` →
 *      MRO walk skipping self
 *   2. **Case 0 (compound)** — receiver has `.` or `(` → compound resolver.
 *      Also emits the interface-dispatch fan-out when the folded receiver type
 *      is an Interface (#2829) — see Case 4, which does the same.
 *   3. **Case 0.5 (implicit `this` receiver)** — GATED: fires only when
 *      the language sets `resolveThisViaEnclosingClass === true` AND the
 *      receiver is literally `this` → enclosing-class + MRO chain walk
 *      with C++ member-name-hiding semantics. Languages that leave the
 *      toggle unset skip this case entirely; their `this` sites fall
 *      through to Case 4 via the synthesized `this` typeBinding (which
 *      emits the interface-dispatch fan-out that this case does not —
 *      as do Cases 0 since #2829 and 3b since #2832; Case 0.5 remains
 *      the only fold-or-walk case without it).
 *   4. **Case 1 (namespace)** — receiver in `namespaceTargets` → exported def
 *   5. **Case 2 (class-name / static receiver)** — receiver resolves to a
 *      class-like binding (Class/Interface/Struct/Record/Enum/Trait) → MRO
 *      walk on that class. Also handles static-style invocations
 *      (`ILogger.Warn(...)`) with kind-aware reason/confidence for
 *      read/write ACCESSES.
 *   6. **Case 3 (dotted typeBinding for namespace prefix)** —
 *      `typeRef.rawName` like `models.User`
 *   7. **Case 3b (chain-typebinding)** — `typeRef.rawName` has a dot
 *      but not a namespace prefix → compound resolver. Also emits the
 *      interface-dispatch fan-out when the folded receiver type is an
 *      Interface (#2832) — same call Cases 0 and 4 make.
 *   8. **Case 4 (simple typeBinding)** — `typeRef.rawName` has no dot →
 *      MRO walk + `findOwnedMember`, then an opt-in concrete-subtype fan-out
 *      when the normal member is missing
 *   9. **Case 5 (value-receiver bridge)** — receiver is a `Const`/`Variable`
 *      whose `nodeId` is referenced as an `ownerId` in `model.methods`
 *      (object-literal services). Last-resort fallback for lowercase
 *      receivers with no class-like or type-binding match. Mirrors
 *      the legacy DAG bridge in `call-processor.ts`.
 *  10. **Case 6 (class-level member receiver)** — `Holder.repo.save(u)`,
 *      where the receiver's head is a CLASS and the one hop past it is a
 *      class-level (`isStatic`) field. Types the receiver from that field
 *      DEF's declared type rather than from a `typeBindings` entry, which
 *      is the thing a per-scope binding map cannot hold for a class that
 *      declares both a static and an instance member of one name. Gated on
 *      Case 0 having declined the same receiver, so it only ever adds an
 *      edge where there was none. Emits the interface-dispatch fan-out
 *      alongside Cases 0, 3b and 4.
 *
 * Reordering or merging cases changes resolution semantics.
 *
 * **Contract Invariant I5 — pre-seeding `seen` is forbidden.** The
 * orchestrator runs this pass FIRST (before `emitReferencesViaLookup`)
 * and consumes the populated `handledSites` set. Pre-seeding `seen`
 * from the shared resolver's emissions (an old optimization) actively
 * suppresses correct emissions for sites the shared resolver also
 * resolved to a wrong target.

   * Can an INSTANCE-typed receiver reach this member? A static member cannot be,

   * (TypeScript rejects it outright as TS2420, "Property 'save' is missing"), so
   * an edge to it from an `I`-typed receiver names a target no dispatch can
   * produce. Every comparable tool draws the same line: tsserver partitions
   * static from instance results, clangd gates on `isVirtual()` (C++ forbids
   * virtual statics), jdtls filters abstract-or-static, and class-hierarchy
   * analysis expands only VIRTUAL call sites — a static call already has exactly
   * one target and needs no fan-out.
   *
   * Two sources answer this, and the order matters:
   *
   *   1. `provider.isStaticOnly` when the language declares it. It is the
   *      precise answer, because a language that needs the distinction defines
   *      it exactly — Kotlin marks only COMPANION-promoted defs, so a Kotlin
   *      `object Impl : Iface { override fun handle() }` is correctly kept: an
   *      `object` is a singleton INSTANCE and its members really are reachable
   *      through an `Iface`-typed receiver.
   *   2. Otherwise the graph node's `isStatic`. For every language that does not
   *      declare the hook, that flag comes from the member's own modifier (or,
   *      for Ruby, from `singleton_class` — `def self.foo`, which is likewise
   *      unreachable through an instance), so it means what we need here.
   *
   * Getting that order wrong is a live regression, not a hypothetical: the
   * method extractor derives `isStatic` from the OWNER type as well as the
   * member (`method-extractors/generic.ts`, `staticOwnerTypes`), and the JVM
   * config lists `object_declaration`. Reading the flag first would delete
   * Kotlin object implementations from the fan-out. A language that needs
   * precision declares the hook; that is the upgrade path.
   *
   * Unresolvable defs fail open (treated as reachable), matching
   * `isDeclarationOnly` and the rest of this pass.

      // `Holder.repo.save(u)` — the receiver `Holder.repo` reaches a value
      // through a CLASS-LEVEL member. Both routes that type a compound
      // receiver (the structural fold and the text cascade) read the same
      // place for the `repo` hop: the owning class scope's `typeBindings`.
      // A scope has ONE `typeBindings` map with no static/instance split, so
      // a language that declares both `p` and `static p` cannot record both
      // — and at least two resolve that collision by not recording the
      // static one at all, leaving `Holder.repo` with nothing to type
      // against. A language that nests its class-level members in a scope of
      // their own (a companion/singleton body) lands in the same place from
      // the other direction: the binding exists, but not in the scope keyed
      // by the class the receiver names. Both were MEASURED as emitting no
      // edge at all, generic field and non-generic control alike.
      //
      // The definition side does not have that ambiguity: a class-level
      // member and an instance member of one name are two distinct defs, and
      // the graph node carries both `isStatic` and the member's declared
      // type. So this case types the receiver off the DEF rather than off a
      // typeBinding, and needs no scope-tree change to do it.
      //
      // ── WHY THIS CANNOT MINT A STATIC-TARGETED EDGE ────────────────────
      //
      // `Holder.repo` is a static FIELD whose TYPE is `Repo`; the value it
      // holds is an INSTANCE. So "reached through a class-level member" says
      // nothing about the target: `save` is looked up with the ordinary
      // `pickFirstNonStaticOnly` instance walk that Cases 0/3b/4 use, and a
      // static-only `save` is skipped exactly as it is there. A genuine
      // static CALL (`Repo.create()`) never arrives here — its receiver is a
      // bare class name with no dot, which Case 2 owns and this case's
      // two-part receiver requirement excludes.
      //
      // The `isStatic === true` requirement on the FIELD is the load-bearing
      // guard in the other direction: the head resolved to the class itself,
      // so only a class-level member is reachable through it, and an
      // instance field of the same name must not be substituted. That is a
      // POSITIVE selection among the defs that exist, never a filter that
      // deletes otherwise-valid targets — the distinction that matters for a
      // language whose singleton/companion members all carry `isStatic` from
      // their OWNER type, where the flag being set is precisely what makes
      // reaching them through the type name correct.
      //
      // Runs LAST, and only for a receiver Case 0 already declined
      // (`compoundReceiverUnresolved`): a site any earlier case resolved
      // keeps that answer, so this can only turn a missing edge into an edge
      // and never retarget an existing one. Contract Invariant I4 holds —
