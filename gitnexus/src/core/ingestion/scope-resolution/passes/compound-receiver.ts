 *
 * ── WHY NOT `findClassBindingInScope(scope, typeRef.rawName)` ────────────────
 *
 * `rawName` is post-normalization, and several providers reduce a type
 * APPLICATION to its base name at capture time (`Mapped[User]` → `Mapped`,
 * `Repo<User>` → `Repo`). Handing that base name to the bare lookup takes its
 * workspace-wide qualified-name fallback, which consults no scope, no import
 * and no module: it binds whatever the workspace happens to declare under that
 * name. A third-party `Mapped[User]` beside an unrelated workspace
 * `class Mapped` then produces a confident WRONG edge — strictly worse than the
 * missing one it replaced, and not recoverable downstream.
 *
 * `resolveClassBindingForName` owns the grounding rule for exactly this
 * ({@link resolveErasedBaseName}: the scope chain binds the name, or the
 * declaration is in the same file, or the index proves the name is a template
 * family, or the file has no cross-file class channel to be absent from), but it
 * is entered on the SPELLING — a name that already lost its arguments is
 * indistinguishable from an ordinary class name. {@link erasedTypeApplication}
 * restores the application from `declaredSpelling`, which is what puts a
 * capture-time-erased receiver back on the grounded route.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS ONE HELPER AND NOT FIVE CALL SITES ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * This file types a receiver position from a `TypeRef` in five places — the
 * structural fold's member step and its module-hoist branch, the cascade's
 * bare-identifier binding, the cascade's dotted-chain HEAD, and the cascade's
 * per-segment member walk. They are five routes to ONE question, and only three
 * were wired to the grounded lookup, which is what left the hole: a Python
 * `self.m.save(u)` whose fold step correctly refused fell THROUGH to the
 * cascade — a declined fold is documented as "no answer", never a veto — and
 * the cascade's own ungrounded member walk re-minted the very edge the grounds
 * had just rejected. One shared helper is what makes "the fold refused" and
 * "the cascade refused" the same sentence, rather than two lookups that happen
 * to agree until one of them is edited.
 *
 * `stripDecoration` stays a per-caller argument because it is a DIFFERENT
 * normalization with its own risk — its own docstring records that turning a
 * former `undefined` into a hit suppresses the `?? otherResolver(...)`
 * fallbacks two dozen call sites rely on. The three fold/binding callers pass
 * the provider's stripper as they always have; the two cascade callers pass
 * nothing, as they always have. So the only behaviour this helper changes
 * anywhere is the erasure grounding, and a `TypeRef` that was never reduced
 * resolves through the identical `findClassBindingInScope` call it did before
 * (`resolveClassBindingForName` tries that first, and a name with no `<`
 * returns immediately after it).
