/**
 * Summarize interfaces whose structural-satisfaction check could not be
 * COMPLETED, for persistence in `RepoMeta` (#2873).
 *
 * The distinction this exists to preserve: an interface with no implementors in
 * the graph and an interface whose implementors could not be decided are
 * byte-identical at query time — both are zero edges. Only the first is an
 * answer. Without this record, `impact()` on a method reachable solely through
 * the second reports zero callers and calls that result `exact`.
 *
 * It rides in `RepoMeta`, not the graph, for the same reason
 * `UnresolvedReceiverSummary` does: the fact is about the ANALYSIS rather than
 * about the code, so it belongs beside the analysis, and a relationship
 * property would move `SCHEMA_FINGERPRINT` and force a full re-analyze. It also
 * keeps the marker invisible to every IMPLEMENTS consumer — MRO,
 * METHOD_IMPLEMENTS derivation, dispatch fan-out, clustering, DI — none of
 * which should see a question as an edge.
