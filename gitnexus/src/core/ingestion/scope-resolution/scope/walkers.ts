/**
 * Scope-chain lookup primitives shared across language providers.
 *
 * Five functions:
 *   - `findReceiverTypeBinding` — walk scope.typeBindings up the chain
 *     for a receiver name.
 *   - `lookupBindingsAt` — read finalized + augmented binding refs at
 *     one scope, deduped by `def.nodeId`. The dual-source-aware
 *     primitive every other binding lookup composes with.
 *   - `findClassBindingInScope` — walk scope.bindings + the indexes via
 *     `lookupBindingsAt` for a class-kind binding.
 *   - `findOwnedMember` — find a method/field owned by a class def
 *     across all parsed files by (ownerId, simpleName).
 *   - `findExportedDef` — find a file-level exported def (top-of-module
 *     class / function) by simpleName.
 *
 * Next-consumer contract: every OO or module-capable language hits the
 * same pre-finalize / post-finalize binding split and the same
 * "resolve member on owner with MRO" pattern. All four are reusable
 * as-is for TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, etc.

 * would enrol every language's aliases (Rust `type_item`, Kotlin/Swift/Dart

 * "find the shape so I can look up a member"; keep `isClassLike` where the
 * question is inheritance. The call sites announce which they are:

 * case in `test/integration/resolvers/zig.test.ts`), so it is a shape. It
 * lives in `isClassLike` because that is the label set the ownership walkers
 * consult, NOT because unions inherit: Zig has no inheritance and its scope
 * resolver supplies no heritage hooks, so a `Union` never has supertypes and
 * its MRO is just itself. C/C++ unions still do not emit `Union` defs on the
 * scope side, so nothing changes for them.

 * NOT YET INCLUDED, deliberately: `Typedef`. It belongs here conceptually but
 * is not wired as a member container today, so adding it would widen a

/**
 * Does something between `inScope` and its module scope bind `name` to

 *
 * `isNamespaceNameShadowed` asks the same question for a namespace handle,
 * where any local binding of the name is by definition not the import. A
 * CONTAINER receiver needs the extra clause: the container may itself be the
 * local declaration (`fn make() { const Local = struct {…}; … Local.go … }`),
 * and reading that as its own shadow would suppress exactly the resolutions it
 * is meant to permit — the #2723 mistake, one channel over.
 *
 * So a scope that binds the name answers immediately, and the answer is "not
 * shadowed" only when one of that scope's bindings IS `def`. A name bound in a
 * nearer scope to something else — a parameter, a local, a type binding — wins
 * the lexical race, which is the whole point: `findClassBindingInScope` filters
 * the chain by `isClassLike` and therefore cannot see that it lost it.
 *
 * The MODULE scope is inspected too, unlike `isNamespaceNameShadowed`, and the
 * exemption is what makes that safe. That guard stops one rung short because a
 * namespace import writes its own name into the module scope and would read as
 * its own shadow (#2723); here the owner is compared by identity, so the binding
 * that IS the owner exempts itself and only a binding to something ELSE answers
 * `true`. Stopping short would leave the exact hole this walk exists to close:
 * `findClassBindingInScope` steps over a module-scope binding that is not
 * class-like and then answers from a WORKSPACE-wide qualified-name index, so
 * `const Gauge = @import("other.zig").SOME_CONST;` in a file that never imports
 * `Gauge.zig` would still resolve `Gauge.read` to that file's container.
 * `lookupBindingsAt` is used at that scope and only there, because an imported
 * alias lives in the finalized channel rather than in `scope.bindings`.
 *
 * Fail-closed like its sibling: a missing scope or a parent cycle answers
 * `true`, because suppressing a resolution costs a missing edge while trusting a
 * corrupt chain costs a wrong one.

 * Measured (#2899): a TypeScript `type Maybe<Result> = Result | null` opens no
 * scope — only the `object_type` alias form does — so its parameter list landed
 * in the MODULE's `ownedDefs`. Since each scope's answer is built from its
 * parent's, `Result` was then bound as a type parameter in every scope in the
 * file, and the `USES` guard downstream deleted every genuine edge to the
 * `interface Result` beside it, imported ones included. One un-anchored
 * parameter list silently emptied an entire file of the edge class that answers
 * "what breaks if I remove this field?".
 *
 * Compares the def's declaration position with the scope's start — the same
 * alignment test `pickCallerCallableDef` uses to tell a closure from a nested
 * function, and sound for the same reason: when a declaration is itself the
 * scope node, both sides are built from one `Range`. Every language that
 * populates `typeParameters` today anchors them on a declaration that IS a scope
 * node (TS class/interface/function, Java/C#/Kotlin/Rust type declarations, the
 * C++ `class_specifier` inside a `template_declaration`), so the alignment holds
 * wherever the parameters were meant to bind.
 *
 * A `Module` scope is excluded outright rather than left to the position test:
 * a module is opened by the file, never by a declaration, and a declaration
 * written on the file's first line shares its start coordinates.
