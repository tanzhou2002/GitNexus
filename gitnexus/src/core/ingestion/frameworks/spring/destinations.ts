/**
 * Resolution of Spring async messaging DESTINATIONS — the broker address a
 * `@KafkaListener` reads from or a `kafkaTemplate.send(...)` writes to.
 *
 * The capture layer records the destination argument exactly as written and
 * resolves nothing (see `argument-facts.ts`). This module is the other half:
 * it decides WHICH argument names the destination, then walks a four-step
 * cascade to turn that argument's source text into an address. It is pure —
 * no graph, no filesystem, no parser — so every rule below is unit-testable
 * against a string, and `pipeline-phases/spring-destinations.ts` is left with
 * only node and edge emission.
 *
 * ── THE INVARIANT THIS MODULE EXISTS TO PROTECT ──────────────────────────
 *
 * An address that could NOT be resolved must never become a shared identity.
 * Two unrelated services that each merely write
 *
 *     @KafkaListener(topics = "${app.topic}")
 *
 * have said nothing about each other. If the graph keyed a destination node on
 * that placeholder text, they would land on one node and READ AS CONNECTED —
 * and a false edge is worse than a missing one, because a missing edge is
 * visible as a gap while a false one enters reports as a fact.
 *
 * So this module never returns a placeholder, a constant name, or any other
 * unresolved spelling as an `address`. An unresolved candidate comes back as
 * `{ kind: 'unresolved', reason }` with no address at all, and the phase keys
 * such a node by its SOURCE LOCATION. A status flag would not have been
 * enough: the two services would still share whatever key the node was minted
 * from. Only withholding the key prevents the join.
 *
 * ── REFUSAL IS DATA ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every path that declines to produce an address records WHY, from a closed
 * set ({@link SpringDestinationRefusal}). The measure of this feature is the
 * unresolved fraction, so a silent `continue` would hide precisely the number
 * that says whether it works.
 */

/**
 * Broker family behind a destination, as far as the syntax can attest.
 *
 * Part of the `Destination` node IDENTITY, not merely a label on it: the phase
 * keys a resolved node by `(broker, address)` via the framework-neutral
 * `ingestion/destination-key.ts`, so two brokers claiming one address are two
 * ordinary nodes. Adding or renaming a member here therefore re-keys every node
 * it applies to, which a full re-index absorbs and an incremental one does not
 * — the destination layer is delete-alled and rebuilt graph-wide on every
 * incremental writeback for exactly this class of reason.
 *
 * A member is only added when the SYNTAX attests to it. A guess here becomes a
 * guess in the identity, and the cost of a wrong one is a real pair split in
 * two (see `destinationNodeKey` for why that cost is nonetheless the cheaper
 * of the two failures available).

 * string literal, a qualified reference, or a screaming-snake constant, all of
 * which a payload variable is not. A lowercase bare identifier is NOT confident
 * evidence, so `convertAndSend(topic, payload)` is refused rather than read:
 * the same spelling is how a payload variable looks, and nothing in the syntax
 * separates them. That refusal is the deliberate cost. A refusal is counted and
 * recoverable; a wrong address enters reports as a fact.
 *
 * There is NO positional fallback at rabbit arity 3+. An earlier revision fell
 * back to accepting slot 0 when slot 1 was not confident, which turned the
 * ordinary `convertAndSend(EXCHANGE, routingKey, event)` — routing key in a
 * variable — into a destination whose address was the EXCHANGE NAME. That is
 * the worst possible outcome: an address that looks entirely plausible and can
 * join a `@RabbitListener(queues = "orders")` that has nothing to do with it.
 *
 * ── THE ONE AMBIGUITY, REFUSED RATHER THAN GUESSED ───────────────────────
 *
 * `convertAndSend("orders.rk", "body", correlationData)` fits two overloads at
 * once and they disagree about which slot is the address:
 *
 *     (exchange, routingKey, message)          → the address is `"body"`
 *     (routingKey, message, correlationData)   → the address is `"orders.rk"`
 *
 * Both are real, both are spelled (String, String, ref), and no rule over the
 * syntax separates them. Picking either one publishes the OTHER reading's
 * payload as an address, where a consumer of a queue named after that text
 * joins a publisher that never wrote to it. So neither is picked: the call is
 * refused as `ambiguous-producer-overload` and yields no candidate and no edge.
 *
 * The refusal is narrow on purpose, because over-refusing here costs the
 * ordinary case, and a suppression that eats correct results is the more
 * expensive mistake. It fires ONLY on a STRING LITERAL in slot 1, at the
 * arities where a competing overload exists:
 *
 *   - A literal is no evidence at all. An address and a payload are BOTH
 *     ordinarily written as literals, so the spelling distinguishes nothing.
 *   - A CONSTANT or QUALIFIED reference is evidence, which is the whole premise
 *     of {@link isConfidentAddressShape}: `ORDERS_ROUTING_KEY` and
 *     `Topics.ORDERS_KEY` are how a configured NAME is written, not how a
 *     payload computed at the call site is. Those keep resolving.
 *   - Arity 5 has no competing overload at all —
 *     `(exchange, routingKey, message, pp, correlationData)` is the only
 *     five-argument form — so slot 1 there is the routing key whatever it is
 *     spelled like, and the refusal must not reach it.
 *   - A NAMED argument settles the reading outright, and the name-beats-position
 *     pre-pass above has already returned by then.

 *                      resolves; the key, and the default text when there is
