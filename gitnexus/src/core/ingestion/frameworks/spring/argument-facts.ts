/**
 * One argument of a Spring annotation or of a messaging-template call, captured
 * exactly as it is written in source.
 *
 * Capture-time facts are deliberately UNRESOLVED. When these facts are produced
 * the file's imports are not finalized, constants declared in sibling files do
 * not exist yet, and no configuration source has been read — so a captured
 * `text` may be a string literal, a constant reference (`Destinations.ORDERS`),
 * a property placeholder (`"${app.orders.topic}"`), or an arbitrary expression.
 * Turning any of those into an address is a separate, later phase; nothing here
 * may call a resolver.
 *
 * NOT the same thing as `SpringAnnotationArgument` in `annotation-arguments.ts`,
 * and the two are deliberately not merged:
 *
 *  - Source. This fact is built from AST nodes while the tree is in hand;
 *    `parseSpringAnnotationArguments` re-parses an annotation's `text` much
 *    later, from a string, with a hand-written delimiter scanner.
 *  - Failure. The text parser returns `null` when its scanner cannot balance
 *    the input, and a caller must decide what that means. There is no such
 *    state here: the grammar has already decided where each argument begins
 *    and ends.
 *  - Absence. The text parser answers `[]` both for `@Scheduled` and for
 *    `@Scheduled()`, because a string cannot tell "no list" from "empty list"
 *    without re-deriving it. Capture keeps the two apart — absent versus `[]` —
 *    so downstream code can rely on the distinction wherever arguments were
 *    read at all. A capture that reads them for only some of its facts says so
 *    on its own `args` field.
 *  - Scope. This fact also describes CALL arguments (`template.send(topic, p)`),
 *    which the annotation parser has no notion of.
 *
 * Collapsing them would mean giving the text parser a failure mode it cannot
 * produce, or taking the three-state distinction away from capture.

   * (`kafkaTemplate.send(topic, payload)`) — always so in Java, which has no
   * named arguments — but a Kotlin call may name its arguments whenever the
   * callee is itself declared in Kotlin, and then the key is captured too.

/**
 * Join an expression that the source wrapped across lines, so that one
 * expression has one spelling no matter where it was written.
 *
 * A receiver chain written as `outer\n    .inner\n    .kafkaTemplate`, and an
 * argument written as `Destinations\n    .ORDERS`, are the same expressions as
 * their single-line spellings. Raw node text would carry the newline and the
 * ENCLOSING BLOCK's indentation across the worker boundary, so the same
 * expression at two nesting depths — or in a CRLF checkout — would not compare
 * equal downstream. Receivers and arguments get the identical treatment on
 * purpose: an inconsistent rule inside one fact is a trap for the phase that
 * has to match a publish against a subscription.
 *
 * Only a run of whitespace that CONTAINS A NEWLINE and sits next to a dot is
 * removed, and only OUTSIDE a string literal. Single-line spacing is left
 * alone, so `registry.get("a . b").template` keeps its argument exactly as
 * written; literal-awareness extends that to Java text blocks and Kotlin raw
 * strings, whose embedded newlines are part of the value and must survive
 * (`"""line-a\n.line-b"""` is not the same string as `"""line-a.line-b"""`).
 *
 * Wraps that are not adjacent to a dot (`"a" +\n  "b"`) are left as written:
 * normalizing them would have to reason about operators, and the same
 * conservatism already applies to receivers.
