/**
 * Subgraph extraction for incremental DB writeback.
 *
 * Given the FULL ctx.graph produced by the pipeline (all files parsed,
 * all phases run) and the set of file paths whose DB rows must be
 * replaced, produce a smaller KnowledgeGraph that contains:
 *
 *   - Every node whose `properties.filePath` is in `toWriteSet`.
 *   - Graph-wide Community/Process nodes unless `includeDerivedGraphWide`
 *     is false (#3016 incremental preserve). Spring metadata placeholders
 *     and `Destination` nodes are always included — their owning phase
 *     delete-alls them unconditionally before the writeback.
 *   - Every relationship where AT LEAST ONE endpoint is in the writable
 *     set above. Relationships entirely between unchanged-file nodes
 *     are skipped — their rows are still in the DB and re-inserting
 *     them would PK-conflict at COPY time.
 *
 * The resulting subgraph is what gets passed to `loadGraphToLbug` after
 * the orchestrator has deleted the corresponding DB rows. Hydrated
 * unchanged-file rows are never touched in the DB.
 *
 * # Cross-file edge consistency (Finding 1)
 *
 * `extractChangedSubgraph` intentionally does NOT expand the set it is
 * given — expansion is the orchestrator's job, so the SAME expanded set
 * can be fed to both `deleteNodesForFiles` and this function (asymmetry
 * between the delete set and the write set silently corrupts the DB).
 * `computeEffectiveWriteSet` below performs the boundary-crossing 1-hop
 * walk; the orchestrator composes it with its importer-BFS expansion and
 * passes the result here.
 *
 * Why the 1-hop walk is needed: consider a barrel re-export change —
 * file C (a barrel) shifts `export { foo } from './b'` to
 * `export { foo } from './d'`. After scope resolution, file A's CALLS
 * edge to `foo` resolves to D instead of B, even though A's content is
 * byte-for-byte identical:
 *
 *   - Old A→B edge survives in DB (neither A nor B is changed → not deleted)
 *   - New A→D edge is missing (neither A nor D in writable set → skipped)
 *
 * Pulling the unchanged-side file of every writable-boundary-crossing
 * edge into the write set fixes both halves: the orchestrator's
 * `DETACH DELETE` cleans up the stale unchanged-side rows, and the new
 * cross-file edges land because at least one endpoint is now writable.
 *
 * Limitation (documented): if a file X *stopped* importing from a
 * changed file C, X has no edge to C in the new graph, so this 1-hop
 * walk doesn't catch it. The orchestrator's importer-BFS (which reads
 * IMPORTS from the pre-pipeline DB) covers that case instead.

 * full or it is simply lost.
 *
 * The endpoint-writability rule cannot carry it. A RESOLVED destination stores
 * no `filePath` at all — deliberately, so an incremental delete keyed on
 * `filePath IN [...]` cannot cut a node shared across files — and the include
 * test below starts from exactly that property. The result was a defect in both
 * directions: a newly added file publishing to a new topic reported
 * `added=1, exit 0` and silently put neither the destination nor the
 * publisher's edge into the graph, so after the first index every new topic was
 * invisible until a full rebuild; and a destination whose last referrer stopped
 * referring to it survived forever as an edgeless orphan still carrying
 * `address`, the cross-repository join key.
 *
 * Unresolved destinations DO carry a file path and would ride the ordinary
 * rule, but they are included here too: the delete-all removes them as well, so
 * anything not re-included would be dropped rather than merely stale.

// `CALL_SUMMARY` (PDG FU-C) is intra-procedural (a callee's RETURN-VALUE ASCENT

// incremental `--pdg` writeback to keep the emit path single — so it must be
// re-included from the FULL fresh graph (which the emit phase recomputes every
// run) or an unchanged function's summary would be lost. Cheap: one self-loop
// edge per return-flowing function.
//
// `INJECTS` (DI collection injection, #2200) is the same class as TAINT_PATH
// (the #2084 M4 U6 pattern above): its validity is a whole-program property —
// a change to a THIRD file (the interface itself, or a new/removed
// implementer) creates or invalidates edges between two files that were never
// touched, so the endpoint-writability rule would strand a stale
// consumer→implementer edge (or miss a new one). Always re-extracted from the
// fresh graph; the orchestrator unconditionally delete-alls the old rows
// first (`deleteAllInjects`). Crash-recovery: delete-then-COPY is not atomic
// by design — a crash between them loses INJECTS edges until the next
// analyze, and the `incrementalInProgress` dirty flag (saved before any
// delete) forces a full rebuild on the next run. Temporary absence is
// possible; duplicates are not.
//
// Spring auto-configuration DECLARES edges (#2415) are also recomputed from
// repository-wide metadata. A third-file class addition/removal can retarget
// an unchanged declaration, so they need the same global re-extract contract.
// DECLARES itself is generic, however: only the two Spring-owned reasons are
// graph-wide, leaving future metadata systems under their own lifecycle.
