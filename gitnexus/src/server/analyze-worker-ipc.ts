/**
 * JSON-safe projection of `AnalyzeResult` for the analyze-worker → parent IPC
 * boundary (#2112 boundary audit; #2135).
 *
 * The forked analyze worker (`analyze-worker.ts`) reports completion to the
 * parent over `child_process` IPC, which uses Node's DEFAULT `'json'`
 * serialization — `api.ts` forks the worker with no `serialization:` option, so
 * the channel runs `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse`, NOT V8 structured clone.
 *
 * `AnalyzeResult.pipelineResult` is populated on every successful analysis
 * (`run-analyze.ts`) and carries `pipelineResult.graph` — the live
 * `KnowledgeGraph` closure object. Sending the raw result across this channel is
 * wrong three ways:
 *   1. Waste — the graph's `nodes`/`relationships` getters force-materialize the
 *      ENTIRE graph into two arrays, then JSON-stringify them, on every analyze.
 *      On a large repo (the #2112 scenario) that is a multi-hundred-MB
 *      stringify+parse whose result is immediately discarded.
 *   2. Silent corruption — the graph's methods are own function properties;
 *      `JSON.stringify` drops them with no error, so a `pipelineResult.graph`
 *      that survived the wire is a data-only husk whose `forEachNode(...)` throws
 *      "is not a function" far from the cause.
 *   3. Conditional crash — a BigInt or circular reference anywhere in the
 *      payload makes `process.send` throw `TypeError` synchronously; the throw is
 *      caught in the worker and re-sent as `{type:'error'}`, turning a
 *      SUCCESSFUL analysis (DB already written) into a reported FAILURE. This is
 *      the #2112 failure family on the server path, and — unlike the parse-worker
 *      result boundary — it has no clone-safety net.
 *
 * The parent (`api.ts`) reads only `result.repoName`; `pipelineResult`'s real
 * consumers (CLI skill generation) call `runFullAnalysis` in-process and never
 * cross this fork. So the worker sends an explicit allowlist of the scalar
 * fields, JSON-safe by construction.

/**
 * The JSON-safe subset of `AnalyzeResult` that crosses the analyze-worker IPC
 * boundary. A `Pick` allowlist — NOT `Omit<…, 'pipelineResult'>`. With `Pick`
 * the allowlist IS the type, so the projection is exhaustive by construction:
 * `projectAnalyzeResultForIpc`'s return literal must name exactly these keys
 * (omitting one is a compile error), and a new field added to `AnalyzeResult`
 * is simply absent from the wire until it is *deliberately* added here. `Omit`
 * couldn't give that guarantee — it kept every other field, including OPTIONAL
 * ones (e.g. `isPrimaryBranch?`), so an optional non-serializable field could be
 * advertised by the type yet silently dropped by the runtime allowlist.
 *
 * `isPrimaryBranch` IS on the wire, under exactly the rule this comment used to
 * cite for excluding it: a server-side consumer now needs it. `analyze-launch.ts`
 * settles the index the run actually wrote, and only the worker knows whether
 * core chose the flat slot or a `branches/<slug>/` sub-slot. It is a boolean, so
 * it is JSON-safe by construction.
