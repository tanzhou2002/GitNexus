 * current; `unknown` is included via `includeUnknown`. Otherwise
 * `staleness.status` says what git could establish: `behind` with the counted
 * `commitsBehind`; `diverged` when HEAD has provably moved off the indexed
 * commit but the history needed to count the gap is gone — the state a
 * branch-pinned `url` clone reaches once git prunes the commit a failed
 * re-index left behind; or `unknown` when the repository could not be
 * measured at all.
 *
 * Hot read tools (`query`/`context`/`impact`/`cypher`) use the ref-carrying
 * form: they emit `unknown` (and `current`) with `branch?`/`lastCommit`/
 * `indexedAt`/`measuredAgainst`.
 *
 * All of it measures the index against the local working tree — the same thing
 * `gitnexus status` and MCP `list_repos` measure — not against the remote.
