 * module exists to prevent is only observable END TO END (a client watching the
 * stream), and a contract that can only be checked by regex over api.ts's source
 * is not a contract. Nothing here imports the database or MCP; `express` is a
 * TYPE-only import, so the runtime cost of loading this module is validation.ts
 * plus analyze-job.ts. Import it from HERE — routing through api.ts re-imports
 * everything the extraction was meant to avoid.

 * The wire payload of a terminal (`event: complete` / `event: failed`) frame.

 * `undefined` fields are dropped by `JSON.stringify`, which keeps a clean run's
 * payload byte-identical to the pre-`partial` shape.
 *
 * `repoPath` is omitted: `/api/ops` enumerates job ids, so this unauthenticated
 * stream must not replay the analyzed filesystem path. `repoName` is a display
 * label and is not unique; reconnect by matching `repoId` against the `id` on
 * `GET /api/repos` entries. Progress text and `error` use the same
 * public redaction as `/api/ops` / poll — raw clone URLs and home-directory
 * paths stay off the wire.

/**
 * Mount an SSE progress endpoint for a JobManager.
 * Handles: initial state, terminal events, heartbeat, event IDs, client disconnect.
 *
 * Terminal payloads carry the display `repoName` and the opaque `repoId`,
 * never a path. The analyzed filesystem
 * path used to ride this event for duplicate-basename reconnect (#2420), but
 * `/api/ops` lists job ids and this stream is unauthenticated — emitting
 * `repoPath` leaked operator home directories. Clients reconnect by `repoId`.
 * Exported for unit tests that lock the wire payload shape.
 *
 * ── The stream closes on the JOB'S STATUS, never on a phase string (#2790) ──
 * This used to end the response as soon as a progress event carried
 * `phase: 'complete'` or `'failed'`. /api/embed maps the pipeline's `ready`
 * phase, which `runEmbeddingPipeline` emits UNCONDITIONALLY — including when it
 * dropped nodes to endpoint failures — and the route only decides the real
 * outcome after the pipeline returns. So the relay wrote `event: complete` with
 * `error: undefined`, called `res.end()` and unsubscribed; the route's later
 * `updateJob({status:'failed'})` was emitted into a stream nobody was listening
 * to. An SSE client saw a tolerated partial run as a clean success while a
 * `GET /api/embed/:jobId` poller saw `failed` — the two consumers of one job
 * disagreeing about whether the data is complete.
 *
 * `updateJob` already synthesizes exactly one terminal progress event (and
 * refuses every update once the job is terminal, #2264 P3), and it assigns the
 * status BEFORE emitting — so asking the job is both sufficient and the only
 * source that cannot be spoofed by an intermediate phase label.
