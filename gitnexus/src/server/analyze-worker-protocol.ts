/**
 * Analyze-worker IPC message protocol — the shapes that cross the
 * `child_process.fork()` boundary between `analyze-launch.ts` (parent) and
 * `analyze-worker.ts` (child).
 *
 * This module exists so the protocol has a home that neither participant sits
 * downstream of. The types previously lived in `analyze-worker.ts`, the fork
 * ENTRY module — which meant `analyze-worker-core.ts` (the entry's own
 * side-effect-free core) had to import them back from the entry, forming an
 * `analyze-worker ⇄ analyze-worker-core` import cycle. The edge was type-only
 * and therefore erased at runtime, but it still made the entry module a
 * dependency of its own core in every static reader of the graph (bundlers,
 * cycle detectors, `gitnexus check`).
 *
 * Declarations only — no values, no imports of anything that holds a value at
 * runtime. Every consumer reaches this module through `import type`, so the
 * emitted `analyze-worker-protocol.js` is never loaded by the running worker.
 * That matters here specifically: `analyze-worker.ts` is spawned by path from
 * build output (`dist/server/analyze-worker.js`, see `analyze-launch.ts`), so a
 * module-resolution mistake in this directory surfaces as a worker that never
 * sends `ready`, not as a compile error.
 *
 * `analyze-worker.ts` re-exports the child→parent types so existing import
 * sites (`analyze-launch.ts`, tests) keep working unchanged.
