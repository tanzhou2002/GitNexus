Returns a page of repositories — each with name, path, indexed date, last commit, and stats — plus a "pagination" object: { total, limit, offset, returned, hasMore, nextOffset }.

PAGINATION: Results are paginated so a large registry is not truncated by MCP/LLM token limits. "limit" sets the page size (default ${LIST_REPOS_DEFAULT_LIMIT}, max ${LIST_REPOS_MAX_LIMIT}; values above the max are rejected, not capped). "offset" selects the start. To enumerate EVERY repository: when pagination.hasMore is true, call list_repos again with offset set to pagination.nextOffset, and repeat until hasMore is false. Repositories are returned in a stable order, so paging never skips or duplicates an entry while the registry is unchanged.

WHEN TO USE: First step when multiple repos are indexed, or to discover available repos.
AFTER THIS: READ gitnexus://repo/{name}/context for the repo you want to work with.

When multiple repos are indexed, repo-scoped read-only tools use the configured
MCP default or the registered path containing the GitNexus process cwd, unless
cwd has crossed into an unindexed nested Git checkout. If neither applies,
specify the "repo" parameter explicitly.`,

    description: `Query the code knowledge graph for execution flows related to a concept.
Returns ranked processes plus a flat process_symbols list. Join processes[].id to process_symbols[].process_id.

WHEN TO USE: Understanding how code works together. Use this when you need execution flows and relationships, not just file matches. Complements grep/IDE search.
AFTER THIS: Use context() on a specific symbol for 360-degree view (callers, callees, categorized refs). With include_content, context() also returns that symbol's source.

Returns results grouped by process (execution flow):
- processes: ranked execution flows with relevance priority. When a process has an HTTP endpoint, each item includes route and method string aliases plus routes: [{ url, method? }] (same shape as context). When chain_depth > 0, each item also includes chain — layered upstream callers + downstream callees from the process entry symbol (same BFS as context({chain_depth})).
- process_symbols: search-hit symbols in those flows with file locations and module (functional area). On the single-repo envelope { processes, process_symbols, definitions }: One row per (id, process_id) — the same symbol id may appear under more than one process. Join a process to its rows by process_id; symbol_count is the number of those rows. When the process entry is among those hits, it is marked is_entry_point: true. With include_content, content appears only on the first row for each symbol id across the whole process_symbols array, not per process; later rows for that id omit it, even under a different process_id. To get content for a row without it, find the earlier row with the same id, or call context({uid: "<id>", include_content: true}). A repo of "@<group>" returns { group, query, results, per_repo } and does not include process_symbols. results[].symbol_count is the member's post-slice attach count; when service is set, it counts only attaches under that prefix. To get process_symbols for one member, query again with repo "@<group>/<memberPath>" (member path from group.yaml, or results[]._repo).
- definitions: standalone types/interfaces not in any process. Keyword hits on Route URLs (route_fts) are bridged to their handler via HANDLES_ROUTE (handlerSymbolId, routes) when the edge exists; use route_map({route}) for the full HTTP surface.

Hybrid ranking: BM25 keyword + semantic vector search, ranked by Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

GROUP MODE: set "repo" to "@<groupName>" to search all member repos in that group (merged via RRF), or "@<groupName>/<groupRepoPath>" to run against a single member (same path keys as in group.yaml). If you use "@<groupName>" only, the member repo defaults to the lexicographically first key in group.yaml "repos". Prefer resources for contracts/status (see migration from legacy group_* tools).

SERVICE: optional monorepo path prefix (POSIX-style, case-sensitive segments). When "repo" starts with "@", only processes whose symbols fall under that prefix are included. For a normal indexed repo name (no leading @), this field is currently ignored by the server.

WHEN TO USE: Complex structural queries that search/explore can't answer. READ gitnexus://repo/{name}/schema first for the full schema.
AFTER THIS: Use context() on result symbols for deeper context.

SCHEMA:
- Nodes: File, Folder, Function, Class, Interface, Method, CodeElement, Community, Process, Route, Tool, Destination
- Multi-language nodes (use backticks): \`Struct\`, \`Enum\`, \`Trait\`, \`Impl\`, etc.
- All edges via single CodeRelation table with 'type' property
- Edge types: ${REL_TYPES.join(', ')} — CFG, REACHING_DEF, TAINTED, SANITIZES, TAINT_PATH, CDG, POST_DOMINATE are populated ONLY on indexes built with \`gitnexus analyze --pdg\` (zero rows on a default index); OVERRIDES is a legacy alias — rows are written as METHOD_OVERRIDES
- Edge properties: type (STRING), confidence (DOUBLE), reason (STRING), step (INT32)

EXAMPLES:
• Find callers of a function:
  MATCH (a)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'CALLS'}]->(b:Function {name: "validateUser"}) RETURN a.name, a.filePath

• Find community members:
  MATCH (f)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'MEMBER_OF'}]->(c:Community) WHERE c.heuristicLabel = "Auth" RETURN f.name

• Trace a process:
  MATCH (s)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'STEP_IN_PROCESS'}]->(p:Process) WHERE p.heuristicLabel = "UserLogin" RETURN s.name, r.step ORDER BY r.step

• Find all methods of a class:
  MATCH (c:Class {name: "UserService"})-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'HAS_METHOD'}]->(m:Method) RETURN m.name, m.parameterCount, m.returnType

• Find all properties of a class:
  MATCH (c:Class {name: "User"})-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'HAS_PROPERTY'}]->(p:Property) RETURN p.name, p.declaredType

• Find all writers of a field:
  MATCH (f:Function)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'ACCESSES', reason: 'write'}]->(p:Property) WHERE p.name = "address" RETURN f.name, f.filePath

• Find method overrides (MRO resolution):
  MATCH (winner:Method)-[r:CodeRelation {type: 'METHOD_OVERRIDES'}]->(loser:Method) RETURN winner.name, winner.filePath, loser.filePath, r.reason

• Find DI-injected providers (provider Classes or synthetic factory declarations):
  MATCH (c:Class {name: 'OrderService'})-[r:CodeRelation]->(provider) WHERE r.type = 'INJECTS' RETURN provider.name, r.reason

• Detect diamond inheritance:
  MATCH (d:Class)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(b1), (d)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(b2), (b1)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(a), (b2)-[:CodeRelation {type: 'EXTENDS'}]->(a) WHERE b1 <> b2 RETURN d.name, b1.name, b2.name, a.name

OUTPUT: Returns { markdown, row_count } — results formatted as a Markdown table for easy reading.

TIPS:
- All relationships use single CodeRelation table — filter with {type: 'CALLS'} etc.
- Community = auto-detected functional area (Leiden algorithm). Properties: heuristicLabel, cohesion, symbolCount, keywords, description, enrichedBy
- Process = execution flow trace from entry point to terminal. Properties: heuristicLabel, processType, stepCount, communities, entryPointId, terminalId
- Use heuristicLabel (not label) for human-readable community/process names
- PDG layers (only when indexed with \`--pdg\`): BasicBlock nodes + CFG / CDG (control dependence, branch sense 'T'|'F' in reason) / REACHING_DEF (def→use, variable in reason) edges, all BasicBlock→BasicBlock. Prefer the \`pdg_query\` tool — it anchors + bounds these for you (raw \`[:CDG*]\`/\`[:REACHING_DEF*]\` path scans are unindexed and unbounded).

    description: `360-degree view of a single code symbol.
Shows categorized incoming/outgoing references (calls, imports, extends, implements, methods, properties, overrides), process participation, and file location.
Also returns (when applicable): routes: [{ url, method? }] — HTTP endpoints this symbol handles via (handler)-[HANDLES_ROUTE]->Route or a Process-linked Route-[ENTRY_POINT_OF]->Process edge; is_entry_point: true when this symbol is a process entry point; chain — layered CALLS neighbours (upstream callers + downstream callees) when chain_depth > 0.

WHEN TO USE: After query() to understand a specific symbol in depth. When you need to know all callers, callees, and what execution flows a symbol participates in.
AFTER THIS: Use impact() if planning changes, or READ gitnexus://repo/{name}/process/{processName} for full execution trace.

Handles disambiguation: if multiple symbols share the same name, returns ranked candidates (each with a relevance score) for you to pick from. Use uid for zero-ambiguity lookup, or narrow the search with file_path and/or kind hints. The ambiguous response carries totalCandidates — the TRUE match count, not candidates[].length — plus candidatesTruncated:true and a "(showing M)" suffix on message when candidates[] is the shorter window.

NOTE: ACCESSES edges (field read/write tracking) are included in context results with reason 'read' or 'write'. CALLS edges resolve through field access chains and method-call chains (e.g., user.address.getCity().save() produces CALLS edges at each step).

COMPLETENESS OF incoming: alongside symbol/incoming/outgoing the result carries the same epistemic envelope impact() returns:
- epistemic: 'exact' | 'lower-bound' — 'lower-bound' means incoming is a FLOOR: either the walk provably missed callers, or a probe that would have established completeness could not run. Do not read it as proof that an omitted caller exists — read boundaries for which of the two it is.
- boundaries: string[] — one plain-language sentence per reason. Prose for humans; branch on causes instead.
- causes: { scopeExtractionFiles, receiverTyping, dispatchBoundary, externalBoundary, undecidedSatisfaction, callableValueReferences } — machine-readable WHY. Every field counts MISSING THINGS, never sentences:
  - causes.scopeExtractionFiles (unit: files) > 0 — scope extraction still failed after the fallback pass, so scope-resolution edges from those files are absent. A value of 0 does not prove completeness when epistemic is 'lower-bound' because an older or unverified index has no measured file count. Re-run \`gitnexus analyze --force\`; if the reason persists, inspect the extraction warnings.
  - causes.receiverTyping (unit: call sites) > 0 — RESOLVER GAP: the analyzer dropped that many call sites on this name because it could not type the receiver, so they are missing from incoming. Do not read an absent caller as proof none exists.
  - causes.externalBoundary (unit: call sites) > 0 — the calls left the indexed program (System.out.println, fetch(...)). NOT a defect: no in-graph node could have been reached. An epistemic:'exact' result can carry this.
  - causes.dispatchBoundary (unit: symbols) > 0 — DI or interface dispatch: that many symbols sit on or beyond a boundary static analysis cannot cross. Irreducible. A symbol count, not a site count — per-site multiplicity is not retained for these edges — so compare its magnitude with receiverTyping, not its exact value. A framework runtime-proxy boundary can make epistemic lower-bound while this value remains 0 because endpoint metadata proves the gap but cannot count omitted symbols.
  - causes.undecidedSatisfaction (unit: unjudged interface/type pairs) > 0 — the analyzer could not decide whether a type satisfies an interface, so no IMPLEMENTS edge exists and no dispatch boundary was left for the walk to notice. Usually fixable by making the missing dependency available to analysis.
  - causes.callableValueReferences (unit: symbols) > 0 — that many symbols name this callable as a VALUE instead of calling it (a Zig registration table or const initialiser, a JS/TS object-literal property value). A bare callback argument in JS/TS is not captured today and is not counted, so a 0 does not rule that shape out; nor does it, on an index built before the language emitted these captures — re-analyze first. The reference is in the graph as a USES edge; the call made THROUGH the value is not, because it is dispatched later from wherever the value was stored. incoming.calls is therefore a floor. Follow the USES edges to find the registration, then the code that reads it. It is 0 when the analyzer DID synthesize the dispatch through a registered property key. That exclusion is per SYMBOL, not per registration: a target with BOTH a followed registration and an unfollowed escape reads 0 here, so a 0 means 'no unfollowed registration was proven', not 'this symbol escapes nowhere'. A 0 alongside epistemic 'lower-bound' can also mean the probe itself could not run — read boundaries for which.

REQUIRES RE-INDEX: causes.scopeExtractionFiles, causes.receiverTyping, causes.externalBoundary, causes.undecidedSatisfaction, and framework runtime-proxy boundary detection depend on index-time metadata that only a current analyzer writes. Against an older index the metadata can be absent, which is indistinguishable from "nothing was dropped" unless the schema probe detects the stale index — re-run \`gitnexus analyze\` before trusting a zero or an apparently exact result.

GROUP MODE: set "repo" to "@<groupName>" to run context in each member repo (aggregated list), or "@<groupName>/<groupRepoPath>" for one member. If you use "@<groupName>" only, the member defaults to the lexicographically first key in group.yaml "repos".

SERVICE: optional monorepo path prefix (case-sensitive path segments). When "repo" starts with "@", prefix-matches resolved symbol file paths; when a hit is outside the prefix, that member returns an empty payload for the symbol. Ignored for a normal indexed repo name.

GIT WORKTREE SUPPORT: GitNexus automatically detects when the MCP server was launched from inside a linked git worktree and runs git diff against that worktree — no extra parameters needed in the common case. Pass "worktree" explicitly only when the server was started from a different directory than the worktree you are editing (e.g., the server runs from the canonical root but your changes are in a linked worktree at a different path).

Returns: changed symbols, affected processes, and a risk summary.
- partial: true — mapping is incomplete, so risk_level is "unknown" instead of a ranked level. A failed symbol query (or an unparseable diff) degrades changed_symbols, both counts, and derived processes; a failed process lookup degrades only affected_processes and risk, leaving changed-symbol counts sound. unmapped_files lists changed supported source files with no mapped symbols, including source renames without hunks: their symbols may be missing, unindexed, or outside indexed ranges even when every query succeeded. Rebuild the index and inspect those diffs; retry alone may not resolve this state. changed_count:0 with partial:true is NOT a clean pre-commit check.
- truncated: true — the changed_symbols LISTING was capped for this response. summary.changed_count counts every symbol the run observed: the true total normally, a LOWER BOUND when partial:true. Compare it with the array length rather than trusting the array.`,

    description: `Run read-only structural checks against the indexed graph.

Currently detects directed cycles between File nodes connected by IMPORTS edges, counting only
edges that force a module-initialization order — a deferred import (\`import()\`, or one written
inside a function body) and a TypeScript \`import type\` are excluded, because neither can make the
modules impossible to initialize.

READ \`enumeration\` BEFORE \`cycleCount\`:
- \`enumeration: 'complete'\` — every elementary cycle is listed; \`cycleCount\` is their number.
- \`enumeration: 'component-representatives'\` — the full enumeration exceeded a safety limit, so
  \`cycles\` holds ONE representative per circular component, \`truncated\` is true, and
  \`cycleCount\` is **null**. Do not compare \`cycleCount\` numerically here: \`null > 0\` is false,
  so a caller keying on it alone concludes "clean" on exactly the most tangled repositories. Use
  \`status === 'cycles_found'\`.

\`componentCount\` (independent circular components) is present in both modes and is the number to
act on and to trend: cutting one import can remove thousands of elementary cycles at once, so
\`cycleCount\` swings wildly for small changes while \`componentCount\` stays stable.

A graph too large to analyze at all returns \`{ error, truncated: true }\` with no \`status\`.`,

    description: `Analyze the blast radius of changing a code symbol.
Returns affected symbols grouped by depth, plus risk assessment, affected execution flows, and affected modules.

MODE (opt-in): "callgraph" (default) walks symbol→symbol edges (CALLS/IMPORTS/EXTENDS/IMPLEMENTS) — inter-procedural, the established comparator/default behavior. "pdg" requires an index built with \`gitnexus analyze --pdg\` and returns one unified PDG-facing result: statement-level control/data dependence from the persisted PDG plus inter-procedural symbol reach. The explicit interprocedural surface is interproceduralByDepth/pdgInterprocedural; byDepth remains the compatibility symbol bucket. pdg remains incompatible with crossDepth and @group targets; relationTypes/minConfidence filter the inter-symbol reach.

STATEMENT-ANCHORED PDG SLICE: with mode:'pdg', pass "line" (1-based source line within the target symbol) to seed the dependence slice on the statement at that line and return what depends on it in affectedStatements (line + text). Inter-procedural symbols are still reported through interproceduralByDepth/pdgInterprocedural and the compatibility byDepth bucket. Without "line", pdg returns whole-symbol inter-procedural reach plus local whole-symbol PDG diagnostics.

PDG OUTPUT CONTRACT: every mode:'pdg' result (success, empty, degraded, or error) carries pdgResultVersion:3 — a stable discriminator for external consumers that bumps on any breaking change to the PDG result shape (distinct from the DB schema version). Successful PDG results include mode:'pdg', a full target envelope (id/name/type/filePath), affectedStatements, affectedStatementCount, interproceduralByDepth/pdgInterprocedural for cross-function reach, compatibility byDepth/byDepthCounts, risk:'UNKNOWN', and a note describing the unified contract. Degraded PDG results (no-layer, sub-layer-missing, unknown) keep mode:'pdg', pdgResultVersion:3, target metadata when the target resolves, risk:'UNKNOWN', note/remediation, and empty byDepth parity fields — never a false-safe zero. If depth and limit both bound the slice, truncatedByReasons reports both causes while truncatedBy remains scalar. Return-value-ascent coverage is published structurally at pdgEvidence.ascent — present iff the inter-procedural descent ran, including on an empty slice — with referencesScanned (DISTINCT callees scanned for a CALL_SUMMARY: a distinct-id tally, not a call-site count — two call sites to the same callee count once), returnFlowFound (whether the ascent fired anywhere in the slice), undecodableSummaryCount, examinedComplete (whether that scan covered every callee the index recorded a resolved id for on the visited blocks), incompleteReasons ('traversal-truncated' | 'callee-list-capped' | 'callee-ids-unrecorded'), and callSummaryLayerPresent. Read callSummaryLayerPresent FIRST: false ⇒ a pre-CALL_SUMMARY index, so {referencesScanned:N>0, returnFlowFound:false} is self-consistent and says nothing about the callees — the scan ran, but no layer existed in which a return-flow could be recorded (remedy: re-run gitnexus analyze --pdg). Branch on those fields; the note narrates the same facts in prose for humans and is not a stable contract.

WHEN TO USE: Before making code changes — especially refactoring, renaming, or modifying shared code. Shows what would break.
AFTER THIS: Review d=1 items (WILL BREAK). Use context() on high-risk symbols.

Output includes:
- risk: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL / UNKNOWN. This is the HIGH/CRITICAL edit-gate field. File targets lack process/community membership, so their risk is not directly comparable with symbol risk; use riskSharedAxes to compare the direct/total axes common to both. Group-mode (\`repo: "@…"\`) results lift the same fields to the top-level envelope. The web Graph-RAG impact tool expands File targets to in-file symbols before enrichment, so process/cluster axes remain comparable there. An upstream walk that resolved ZERO callers reports UNKNOWN, never LOW, and carries riskNote: "safe to change" is a claim about callers and there were none to reason about, so the symbol is either genuinely unused OR reached only through a reference class the index does not record (plain-object property access, a bare-identifier read of a module-scope const). Confirm with a text search before acting on it. Downstream walks are unaffected — an empty downstream result reports resolved callees, not safety.
- riskSharedAxes: single-repo risk computed only from direct and total impact. Group mode then applies the cross-repo crossing overlay to that local value. Suitable for comparing File and symbol targets within the same mode. Never substitute it for \`risk\` when deciding whether to warn before edits.
- riskScale: { comparableAcrossKinds, unusedAxes } — names process/module axes that were structurally unavailable, skipped, budget-exhausted (\`IMPACT_MAX_CHUNKS=0\`), truncated (sampled a subset of impacted symbols), or failed at query time. Failed-query and truncated-sample counts are lower bounds: known HIGH/CRITICAL warnings survive, otherwise risk is UNKNOWN. Group impact copies this metadata from the local leg.
- riskNote: string — present only when risk is UNKNOWN; states why the verdict is withheld.
- summary: direct callers, processes affected, modules affected
- affected_processes: which execution flows break and at which step
- affected_modules: which functional areas are hit (direct vs indirect; classification-unavailable when that secondary query fails)
- affected_routes (callgraph mode only): [{ url, method? }] — HTTP endpoints served by the target or any impacted symbol (via HANDLES_ROUTE). Matching callgraph byDepth items also carry routes:[{ url, method? }]. PDG results do not include route enrichment. Reported only; not counted in risk.
- byDepth: affected symbols grouped by traversal depth (paginated by limit/offset; omitted when summaryOnly:true — use byDepthCounts for totals per depth, pagination object when truncated). Each item includes a processes:[{id,label,processType,step}] field listing the execution flows that symbol participates in. Empty when the symbol has no process membership. Can ALSO be empty when partial:true is set — either the process-aggregation pass hit its cap before detecting affected processes, or per-symbol enrichment was capped on a very large page. When partial:true, do NOT treat processes:[] as proof of no participation; cross-check the top-level affected_processes list. An item carries staticGated:true only when the edge that reached it is provably unreachable at compile time from the indexed source (today: Zig calls inside an 'if (CONST_FALSE)' body or the else of 'if (CONST_TRUE)'); the field is absent when the edge is live or the language does not model it. Traversal and risk do NOT filter or rank on it: it is metadata for the caller to weigh.
- epistemic: 'exact' | 'lower-bound' — whether impactedCount is the whole story. 'lower-bound' means the count is a FLOOR: either the walk provably missed callers, or a probe that would have established completeness could not run (a failed callable-value-reference query says so in boundaries). It is not itself proof that an omitted caller exists — branch on causes and read boundaries. Absent only on skipped probes (ambiguous-candidate lists, group fan-out).
- boundaries: string[] — one plain-language sentence per reason the count is short. Prose for humans; branch on causes instead.
- causes: { scopeExtractionFiles, receiverTyping, dispatchBoundary, externalBoundary, undecidedSatisfaction, callableValueReferences } — the machine-readable split of WHY, so an agent gating its own edits can tell a fixable analyzer gap from an irreducible one. Every field counts MISSING THINGS, never sentences:
  - causes.scopeExtractionFiles (unit: files) > 0 — scope extraction still failed after the fallback pass, so scope-resolution edges from those files are absent. A value of 0 does not prove completeness when epistemic is 'lower-bound' because an older or unverified index has no measured file count. Re-run \`gitnexus analyze --force\`; if the reason persists, inspect the extraction warnings.
  - causes.receiverTyping (unit: call sites) > 0 — the RESOLVER GAP signal: the analyzer dropped that many call sites because it could not establish the receiver's type (unresolved constructor, factory, chained expression). Those callers are absent from byDepth. Treat the result as incomplete: grep the symbol name before deleting or renaming.
  - causes.externalBoundary (unit: call sites) > 0 — those calls left the indexed program (System.out.println, fetch(...), os.environ.*). NOT a defect and NOT a reason the count is short: there is no in-graph node any edge could have reached. An epistemic:'exact' result can carry this.
  - causes.dispatchBoundary (unit: symbols) > 0 — DI or interface dispatch: that many symbols sit on or beyond a boundary a static walk cannot cross. Irreducible. A symbol count, not a site count — per-site multiplicity is not retained for these edges — so compare its magnitude with receiverTyping, not its exact value. A framework runtime-proxy boundary can make epistemic lower-bound while this value remains 0 because endpoint metadata proves the gap but cannot count omitted symbols.

  - causes.undecidedSatisfaction (unit: unjudged interface/type pairs) > 0 — the analyzer could not DECIDE whether a type satisfies an interface (a type in a required signature named a package it could not resolve), so no IMPLEMENTS edge exists and no dispatch boundary was left for the walk to notice. Distinct from every cause above, which count decided facts that could not be attributed; this one counts questions never answered. It is the only cause that shortens a result WITHOUT leaving a trace in the graph, so an unhedged zero on a symbol reached only through such an interface would otherwise read as 'nobody calls this'. Usually fixable: it most often means a dependency is missing from the analyzed tree.
  - causes.callableValueReferences (unit: symbols) > 0 — that many symbols name this callable as a VALUE rather than calling it: 'bridge.accessor(Element.getNamespaceUri, ...)' and 'pub const h = onReset;' in Zig, '{ onClick: handler }' in JS/TS. Those are the shapes actually captured today — a bare callback argument in JS/TS ('qsort'-style, 'setTimeout(tick)') is NOT one of them and is not counted, so a 0 here does not rule that shape out. The registration IS modelled (a USES edge); the invocation through the stored value is NOT, because it happens later via a struct field, a registry lookup or comptime reflection. So impactedCount is a floor and a LOW risk verdict on such a symbol is a floor too. Unlike dispatchBoundary this is often reducible — it usually means the language provider does not yet follow that store/load — but until it is, do NOT read an empty or small caller set as 'safe to change'. It is an exact count, not a capped sample. It is 0 when the analyzer DID synthesize the dispatch through a registered property key, and epistemic stays 'exact' on that account. That exclusion is symbol-level, not edge-level — the graph does not record which registration produced which synthesized call — so a symbol with a mix of followed and unfollowed registrations also reads 0: treat a 0 as 'no unfollowed registration was proven', not as proof the value escapes nowhere. A 0 alongside epistemic 'lower-bound' can instead mean the probe could not run at all, so read boundaries to tell those apart. Read from the graph, so it needs no index-time metadata BEYOND the edges being there: an index built by an analyzer that did not yet emit this language's value-ref captures has none, and reports 0. Re-analyze before reading a 0 as measured.

REQUIRES RE-INDEX: causes.scopeExtractionFiles, causes.receiverTyping, causes.externalBoundary, causes.undecidedSatisfaction, and framework runtime-proxy boundary detection depend on index-time metadata that only a current analyzer writes. Against an older index the metadata can be absent, which is indistinguishable from "nothing was dropped" unless the schema probe detects the stale index — re-run \`gitnexus analyze\` before trusting a zero or an apparently exact result.

Depth groups:
- d=1: WILL BREAK (direct callers/importers)
- d=2: LIKELY AFFECTED (indirect)
- d=3: MAY NEED TESTING (transitive)

TIP: For hub symbols (base error classes, shared utilities) with many direct callers, use summaryOnly: true first to see counts and risk, then drill into specific depths with limit/offset. maxDepth alone does not bound output size when most dependents are at depth 1. limit and offset apply independently to each depth level, not to the total result set — use byDepthCounts to see totals per depth.

TIP: Default traversal uses CALLS/IMPORTS/EXTENDS/IMPLEMENTS. For class members, include HAS_METHOD and HAS_PROPERTY in relationTypes. For field access analysis, include ACCESSES in relationTypes.

Handles disambiguation: when multiple symbols share the target name, returns ranked candidates (each with a relevance score) instead of silently picking one. Use target_uid for zero-ambiguity lookup, or narrow with file_path and/or kind hints. totalCandidates is the TRUE match count — it reported the capped resolver window before #2787, so it can now exceed candidates.length; candidatesTruncated:true and a "(showing M of N)" suffix on message mark the shorter window.

EdgeType: CALLS, IMPORTS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS, HAS_METHOD, HAS_PROPERTY, METHOD_OVERRIDES, METHOD_IMPLEMENTS, ACCESSES
Confidence: 1.0 = certain, <0.8 = fuzzy match

GROUP MODE: set "repo" to "@<groupName>" for cross-repo impact anchored at the default member (lexicographically first key in group.yaml "repos"), or "@<groupName>/<groupRepoPath>" to choose the member (same path keys as in group.yaml). Phase-1 walk runs in that member; cross-boundary fan-out uses the group bridge. A cross entry with fanout_status:"not_attempted" proves the declared repository boundary, but its far endpoint has no graph symbol; do not interpret empty by_depth or affected_processes on that entry as a completed zero-impact walk. The fan-out attempts at most 50 neighbour crossings, strongest-confidence first. Any short answer carries truncated:true, truncatedRepos, riskEpistemic:"lower-bound" AND a truncationReason — dropping a crossing can only move risk DOWN, so treat that risk as a floor, never as a verdict. truncated:true does NOT always mean the fan-out ran out of room, so branch on truncationReason: the remedy differs. 'timeout' (the fan-out's wall-clock budget expired) and 'partial' (a neighbour crossing, or the local walk, was cut short) are runtime limits — the same query can return more on a retry or with a larger timeoutMs. 'incomplete-sync' is structural: the group bridge was built by a sync that could not say which repos it read, or that could not read an in-scope repo, so those repos' contracts are absent from EVERY query against this bridge, and truncatedRepos names them even when ZERO crossings to them were attempted. Retrying returns the same floor — run group_sync (\`gitnexus group sync\`) and query again. 'suppressed-stage' is also structural but has a DIFFERENT remedy: the sync was asked to skip a matching stage (\`--exact-only\` / exactOnly), so cross-links that stage would have found are absent BY REQUEST. Re-running the sync unchanged returns the same floor — re-run it WITHOUT that flag. Do not report a repo as broken for this reason; nothing failed to read.

SERVICE: optional monorepo path prefix (case-sensitive path segments). When "repo" starts with "@", scopes the local impact walk and cross-repo symbol paths to files under that prefix; ignored for a normal indexed repo name.

    description: `Explain persisted taint findings recorded by \`gitnexus analyze --pdg\`: intra-procedural source→sink data flows (TAINTED edges, statement-level hops) AND cross-function flows (TAINT_PATH edges, function-level hops, marked \`interprocedural: true\`).

Each finding carries the sink category (command-injection, code-injection, path-traversal, sql-injection, xss) and the ordered hop path. Intra-procedural findings carry source/sink lines and the variable on each hop; interprocedural findings carry the source and sink FUNCTION names and the chain of functions the taint crossed (decoded from the persisted path encoding).

WHEN TO USE: Security review — "what taint findings exist in this repo / file / function?". Requires the repo to be indexed with \`gitnexus analyze --pdg\`; without that layer the tool returns a clear "no taint layer" note, not an error.

ANCHORLESS (no "target"): enumerates all persisted findings for the repo — bounded ("limit", deterministic order), with "totalFindings" and a "truncated" flag.
ANCHORED ("target" = file path or symbol/function name): full hop detail for that anchor. A file-ish target (contains "/" or an extension) filters by file; a symbol name resolves like context() — ambiguous names return ranked candidates plus totalCandidates (the TRUE match count, not candidates[].length), candidatesTruncated:true and a "(showing M)" suffix on message when candidates[] is the shorter window; unknown names return not-found. Symbol anchoring is line-range granular for intra-procedural findings; cross-function findings match when the symbol is the source OR sink function.

CONTRACT CAVEATS (absent flows are NOT proof of safety):
- Cross-function flows ARE modeled (#2084 M4): a source flowing through helper functions into a sink is found, via summary composition over the call graph (context-insensitive — return/call-site merging is accepted).
- Cross-function matching is by callee NAME (context-insensitive): when one caller invokes two distinct same-named callees, a flow into one over-attributes to both — a cross-function finding does not prove the taint reached every same-named function (sound over-report, never a missed flow).
- Closure/callback flows are invisible in both directions (e.g. arr.forEach(() => sink(y))) — the largest false-negative class.
- Property/field flows are not tracked (obj.x = taint; sink(obj.y) has no chain).
- Guard-style sanitizers (if (isValid(x))) and implicit/control-dependence flows are not modeled.
- CommonJS aliasing is partially modeled (require('<literal>') joins resolve; dynamic requires do not).
- Exception-path over-approximation can produce false-positive noise.

Findings are deliberately NOT part of impact()'s traversal or the web schema — explain is the dedicated taint consumer. SANITIZES (kill) edges are queryable via cypher.`,

MODES:
- \`controls\` — "under what condition does X run?". Returns, for the anchored function, each control-dependence edge: the controlling predicate block, the dependent block, and the branch sense ('T' = the predicate's true/taken arm, 'F' = its false/fall-through arm). An edge into an early return/throw block is flagged \`guard: true\` (subsumes the #559 guard heuristic); the branch sense of a guard depends on its predicate — \`if (!ok) return;\` rides the 'T' arm — so don't filter guards by a fixed label.
- \`flows\` — "where does variable Y flow?". Returns REACHING_DEF def→use edges for the anchored function; pass \`variable\` to filter to one binding.

WHEN TO USE: comprehension ("what guards this statement?"), data-flow tracing within a function, guard-clause discovery. Requires \`gitnexus analyze --pdg\`; without that layer the tool returns a clear "no PDG layer" note, not an error.

ANCHORING (required): \`target\` is a file path or a symbol/function name (resolved like context()). PDG queries are ALWAYS anchored — there is no whole-repo enumeration (an unanchored basic-block path scan is unbounded; LadybugDB has no rel-property index). A symbol target is line-range granular; an ambiguous name returns ranked candidates plus totalCandidates (the TRUE match count, not candidates[].length), candidatesTruncated:true and a "(showing M)" suffix on message when candidates[] is the shorter window; unknown returns not-found.

CONTRACT CAVEATS:
- CDG labels are binary 'T'/'F' in M5/M6; per-case \`switch\` arm conditions are not yet distinguished (every case dispatch is 'T').
- Granularity is basic-block, reconstructed to the function via the BasicBlock id + line span (no Function→BasicBlock edge); deeply same-line-packed functions may anchor coarsely.
- Control/data dependence is intra-procedural (per function). Cross-function flow is taint's domain (\`explain\`).
- These edges are deliberately NOT part of impact()'s traversal — \`pdg_query\` is the dedicated consumer; raw edges are also queryable via \`cypher\`.`,

WHEN TO USE: BEFORE modifying any API route handler. Shows what consumers depend on, what response fields they access, what middleware protects the route, and what execution flows it triggers. Requires at least "route" or "file" parameter.

Risk levels: LOW (0-3 consumers), MEDIUM (4-9 or any mismatches), HIGH (10+ consumers or mismatches with 4+ consumers). Mismatches with confidence "low" indicate the consumer file fetches multiple routes — property attribution is approximate.

Response shape is keyed on how many routes match, not on the data: exactly one match returns a single route object; two or more return { routes: [...], total: N }. The same URL can expose multiple HTTP verbs (e.g. GET and POST /api/orders are distinct routes that share the URL), so a bare-URL lookup may return the wrapped form — every route object carries its own "method" so verbs are distinguishable. Pass "method" to narrow to one verb; the single-object shape is returned only when exactly one route remains after filtering — a substring route/file match spanning several URLs can still return the wrapped form. A URL/file that exists but has no route for the given verb returns an error. Each route's "method" is the literal "*" for method-agnostic routes (e.g. Django function views), which match any "method" selector, or null for method-less routes (filesystem, Laravel resource), which never match a selector. Every route also carries "runtimeEvidence"; treat it as authoritative only when runtimeEvidence.confirmed is true. Combines route_map, shape_check, and impact data.`,

READ THE RESULT: \`missingRepos\` are configured repos with no entry in the registry (index them, or drop them from group.yaml); \`unreadableRepos\` ARE registered but this sync could not extract from them — the index would not open (version skew, lock, corruption), or an extractor failed partway — so NONE of their contracts are in this sync and a following group_impact / group_contracts is a lower bound, not a verdict. \`degradedLinks\` is the count of persisted cross-links whose provider endpoint has no resolved graph symbol (\`degraded: true\`); re-analyze the provider so handlers resolve. \`failedRepos\` is \`{ repo, reason }[]\` for per-repo extraction throws — each also appears in \`unreadableRepos\`; \`repo\` is that group path (e.g. app/backend), not the registry display name. \`warnings\` are operator-facing run notes (e.g. bridge.lbug write failed after contracts.json was written); \`[]\` means none this run. \`registryOutcome\` says what happened to the file, and the three values a call here can return each need a different response: 'written' — this run's contracts replaced contracts.json; 'preserved' — nothing could be read, so contracts.json was rewritten keeping the previous sync's contracts and cross-links verbatim and refreshing only \`missingRepos\`/\`unreadableRepos\` to describe THIS run (the file changed, the contracts in it did not, and they are as old as the last sync that succeeded); 'superseded' — nothing could be read, and another sync replaced contracts.json while this one waited for the group lock; that file was left untouched and this run's lists were NOT recorded, because they describe an older group state than what is on disk (so the registry is fresher than this response's diagnostics, not staler); 'no-prior-registry' — nothing could be read AND there was no previous contracts.json to carry forward, so none was written and this group has no contract registry on disk. Only 'no-prior-registry' means there is nothing to read: after it, group_contracts / group_impact have no registry at all rather than a stale one, so fix the repos above and re-run before trusting either. \`suppressedMatchStages\` names matching stages this sync was ASKED to skip, with the same three states as the repo lists: ABSENT means a registry written before the field existed, \`[]\` means this sync suppressed nothing, and a populated list means the cross-link set is a lower bound BY REQUEST — a later group_impact / group_contracts on it reports truncationReason 'suppressed-stage'.\n\nPARAMETERS ARE VALIDATED: \`exactOnly\` must be a real boolean — the string "false" is rejected, not coerced to true.

WHEN TO USE: Debugging "how does A reach B?" — answers in one call what would take 3-8 manual context/impact hops. Shows the exact chain with file:line positions plus a per-hop edge type and confidence.

Traverses CALLS edges plus HAS_METHOD (class → member) edges, so a trace can descend from a class into its methods. Each hop's edge type is reported in edges[], so call hops and containment hops remain distinguishable.

Returns: ordered hops with file:line, and an aligned edges[] of edge type + confidence. When no path exists, reports the furthest reachable node so you know where the chain breaks (and truncated: true if a traversal cap was hit first).

Handles disambiguation: an ambiguous from/to name returns status "ambiguous" with role ("from" or "to"), ranked candidates and totalCandidates — the TRUE match count, not candidates[].length — plus candidatesTruncated:true and a "(showing M)" suffix on message when candidates[] is the shorter window. Re-call with from_uid/to_uid.

CROSS-REPO (experimental): pass repo as "@groupName" to trace across repositories in a group. When from/to live in different member repos, the trace stitches the two repo-local segments across a single ContractLink boundary (e.g. an HTTP consumer→provider link), clamped to one crossing. The result adds crossings[] (the bridged contract with matchType/confidence), tags each hop with its member repo, and a notes[] channel for degraded states. The boundary hop is reported with edge type CONTRACT_LINK. Pass pdg:true to also attach the intra-procedural data-flow (REACHING_DEF) for boundary-adjacent segments when those repos were indexed with --pdg; absent a PDG layer it degrades to call-level hops with a note.

DESTINATION TRACE (cross-repo): for an "@groupName" trace, OMIT to/to_uid/to_file to trace 'from' to wherever its outgoing HTTP call lands. The result ends at the provider endpoint (reported by route + file even when the handler is an anonymous function with no nameable symbol).

The file list is indexed File nodes that still have content. Bytes are read from the working tree, so edits since the last analyze are visible. Hits are 1-based. read_file startLine/endLine are 0-based.

WHEN TO USE: Only after graph tools came back empty or ambiguous — exact-name pinning, docstring fallback, or literal tokens the index does not model (e.g. tactic names inside proof bodies, notation). Graph first (query/context/cypher); grep is the offline-capable fallback, never the default.
AFTER THIS: Read the matching line with read_file({path, startLine: hit.line - 1, endLine: hit.line - 1}) or pin the symbol with context({name}).

Optional caseSensitive and literal match HTTP /api/grep (default: case-insensitive regex). When full source is unavailable the result is code "source-unavailable", not an empty hit list. This tool reads the checkout and does not accept branch. Results carry timedOut: true when the wall-clock budget expired first — re-issue narrower (fileFilter or a tighter pattern).`,
