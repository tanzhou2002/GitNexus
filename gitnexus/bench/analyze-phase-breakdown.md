# Analyze phase breakdown — where the time actually goes

Measured 2026-09-06/07 while landing #3194, #3196 and #3200. Records what the
`analyze` pipeline costs per phase, and — as importantly — the optimizations
that were measured and **rejected**, so the next person does not re-derive them.

Unlike `parse-throughput.md` (a synthetic-fixture scaffold), these numbers come
from a real repo corpus. They are not a CI gate; the gate for the parse
dispatch path is `bench/parse-dispatch-rounds/`.

---

## Method, and one trap that invalidates everything

**The corpus must be a git repository.** A non-git checkout cannot record a
schema fingerprint, so the tool forces a full rebuild on every run and prints:

> `non-git repositories never record a schema fingerprint, so this run rebuilds regardless`

A "warm" run measured that way is a forced cold rebuild wearing a warm label. A
37.7s figure was recorded that way during this work and was meaningless. On a
real git repo an unchanged re-analyze short-circuits to `Already up to date`.

**And the analyzer binary must not change between runs.** Rebuilding or
re-copying `dist` changes the runner identity, and the tool then prints:

> `analyzer runner identity changed ...; forcing a full rebuild so the index
provenance matches the analyzer`

Every run after a rebuild is a full rebuild. To measure the incremental path,
run once to stamp the identity, then edit and run again **without touching
`dist`**. An earlier revision of this document reported full-rebuild numbers as
if they were incremental for exactly this reason; they are corrected below.

**And a mark on an `await` is not a mark on that call.** The post-pipeline tail
was timed by injecting timestamp marks into a disposable `dist`. An `await` that
directly follows native work also absorbs whatever libuv still had queued, so
the cost lands on the wrong line — that is how 845ms ended up attributed to a
dynamic import that actually costs 0.035ms. Sanity-check any mark that lands on
a call with no plausible work in it.

That is three separate "silently fall back to full work" guards — non-git
corpus, runner identity, and the escalation gate. Read the banner on every run
before trusting a number.

Corpus: this repository, `git archive` of HEAD into a scratch dir, then
`git init && git add -A && git commit`. 5350 paths, 2234 parseable, ~30MB.
16 workers, `dist` on a local overlay filesystem (see "Filesystem" below).
Phase numbers come from the `✓ Phase: <name> (<ms>)` lines under
`NODE_ENV=development`; the post-pipeline tail has no such lines and was
measured by injecting timestamp marks into a disposable copy of the built
`dist`.

## Re-analyze after a one-file edit — the developer loop

Leaf file (`cli/update-notice.ts`, 2 importers), stable runner identity, so the
incremental path is genuinely taken. **31.7s total.**

| step                                                  |       ms |   share |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------: | ------: |
| scopeResolution                                       |   ~13900 |     44% |
| **FTS index rebuild** (`buildSearchIndexesOrDegrade`) | **7525** | **24%** |
| graph write (`loadGraphToLbug`, subgraph)             |     3566 |     11% |
| parse                                                 |    ~2800 |      9% |
| post-FTS event-loop drain (see below)                 |      845 |      3% |
| everything else                                       |    ~3000 |      9% |

The 845ms was originally recorded against `import('./platform/capabilities.js')`.
That import is not the cost: the CLI already imports the module statically, so a
cached dynamic import measures 0.035ms and `getRuntimeCapabilities()` 0.1ms. The
`await` there is the first yield after the native FTS build, so it absorbs
whatever libuv work was still queued. Any mark placed on an `await` immediately
after native work charges that work to the wrong line.

The incremental machinery works: the graph write was a 3,980-node subgraph, not
the full 51,288. **Everything the #3194/#3196 parse work optimized is ~9% of
this.**

A FULL-rebuild run of the same repo is 36-39s, with the graph write at ~6.3s and
FTS at ~9.7s. Do not quote those as edit-loop numbers.

## FTS index rebuild — the largest non-resolution cost, and it is a floor

A true incremental leaf edit rebuilds **8** of the 20 configured indexes — the
tables the writeback actually DMLs. Per-index cost (measured against a copy of
the corpus index, `bench/` probe, reproduced within 2% of the in-analyze number):

```
 3541ms  File.file_fts        <- 47% of the incremental FTS cost on its own
 1696ms  Function.function_fts
  521ms  Method     506ms  Const      486ms  Property
  403ms  Interface  324ms  Class      291ms  TypeAlias
 ------
 7769ms  8 indexes   (in-analyze: 7525ms)
```

A FULL rebuild does all 20 and costs ~10.2s; the extra 12 indexes are only
~2.5s, so **the narrowing is already doing its job**. An earlier revision of
this document called the narrowing "inconsistent" because one run rebuilt 8 and
another 20 — the 20-index run was a forced full rebuild (the runner-identity
trap above), not a leaf edit. There is nothing to fix there.

`File.file_fts` dominates because File rows carry whole-file content: 2442 rows,
32.9 MB, and Ladybug tokenizes at ~9.8 MB/s.

### Four ways out, all measured, all closed

**Narrow further — no.** The 8 tables are exactly the ones holding rows for the
6 files in the write set (1 changed + 5 importers). There is no fat.

**Build the indexes concurrently — impossible.** A second connection issuing
`CREATE_FTS_INDEX` fails immediately:

> `Cannot start a new write transaction in the system. Only one write transaction at a time is allowed in the system.`

Eight builds on one connection serialize exactly (7886ms concurrent vs 7769ms
serial).

**Raise the connection's thread count — no effect.** min-of-3 wall time at
4 / 8 / 16 / default(24) threads: 7298 / 7133 / 7109 / 7345 ms, inside the ~400ms
per-config spread. CPU burned does move — 8.8s / 9.7s / 11.8s / 13.6s — so the
default over-subscribes ~60% for nothing, but wall time is flat.

**Skip `File.file_fts` when content did not change — cannot happen.** Any file
edit changes a File row, and Ladybug's FTS is not incremental: an index built
before an insert does not see the new row, so a changed row forces a whole-table
rebuild. Dropping `content` from the index takes it 3541ms → **241ms**, but that
is deleting full-file keyword search (#2317/#2323), not optimizing it. Capping
the indexed content is a bad trade — the size distribution is flat, so a 64 KB
cap still indexes 90% of the bytes while truncating the 72 largest files.

### The one lever left: overlap

The FTS build runs on a libuv thread, not the main thread, and fully overlaps
blocking JS:

```
index alone                    3859ms
index + 3000ms of JS burn      3337ms      (serial would be ~6859ms)
```

So the 3.5s File index could hide entirely behind the pipeline's ~17s of
main-thread JS. File rows are the only ones that make this possible: they are
`{ name, filePath }` from `processStructure`, with content lazy-read from disk at
CSV time, so they are fully determined by the file scan — before parsing, before
resolution.

Two things block it today, and neither is small:

1. The DB is **closed** for the whole pipeline (`closeLbug` before
   `runPipelineFromRepo`, `initLbug` after). An early File write means holding a
   write handle across the pipeline.
2. It moves `liveIndexMutationStarted` before the pipeline. A pipeline failure
   would then leave the live index with fresh File content and stale symbols,
   instead of untouched.

## scopeResolution — 14.7s, and it is two different problems

`PROF_SCOPE_RESOLUTION=1` already exists and reports the internal split. Marks
injected around the phase supply the rest. On a one-file edit:

| step                         |       ms |   share |
| ---------------------------- | -------: | ------: |
| ParsedFile store rehydration |     4426 |     30% |
| **`emit`**                   | **7161** | **49%** |
| `resolve`                    |      966 |      7% |
| `finalize`                   |      552 |      4% |
| `extract`                    |      369 |      3% |
| per-language teardown, misc  |     ~750 |      5% |

`extract` is small because the parse cache works: 2121/2121 pre-extracted hits
on the TypeScript pass. Nothing here re-parses.

### Rehydration: three full store scans, one per language

The corpus resolves three languages — python (54 files), typescript (2121),
javascript (59) — and `loadParsedFilesForPaths` walks **every** shard on each
pass. The store is 413 shards / 301 MB. A pass that wants a single file costs
335 ms, because the skip decision needs the envelope's path listing and that
listing is only trustworthy after the payload digest is checked.

So the fixed cost is paid per language, and **it scales with language count**,
not with how many files that language has. Measured, min-of-5, three passes:

```
before   python 411ms   typescript 2872ms   javascript 507ms   = 3834ms
after    python 415ms   typescript 2805ms   javascript 248ms   = 3484ms
```

Memoizing each shard's authenticated listing for the run removes the repeat
scans (−350 ms here; roughly −250 ms per additional language elsewhere). The
first pass is unchanged by construction — it is what populates the memo.

What is left is a floor. The digest is **not** the cost: SHA-256 over all
301 MB takes 134 ms (2.25 GB/s, hardware-accelerated), so swapping it for
CRC-32 would buy ~90 ms and cost an envelope-format bump. The remainder is
`v8.deserialize` (~1240 ms) plus the cross-shard string intern walk
(~1085 ms), and the intern walk is not optional — dropping it regresses
retained heap ~59%, which is #2649's constraint.

### `emit` is the real target

7.2s, 49% of the phase and ~21% of the whole edit loop. It is a fan of passes,
each walking every reference site in the repo:

```
1828ms  emitCallableValueFlow      480ms  emitFreeCallFallback
1590ms  emitReceiverBoundCalls     426ms  emitReferencesViaLookup
 681ms  resolveDefGraphId          313ms  emitUniqueNamePropertyAccesses
 529ms  lookupCore                 280ms  emitReturnShapeMemberAccesses
 472ms  tryEmitEdge                222ms  emitPropertyDispatchCalls
 449ms  getScope
```

No hot inner loop, nothing quadratic, no single pass worth more than 12% of the
phase. Micro-optimizing any of them is not the win.

The win is not running them. A one-file edit re-emits all 163,094 edges to
write a 3,980-node subgraph. Every pass above runs over all 2121 TypeScript
files because the pipeline rebuilds the full in-memory graph every run and only
the DB _write_ is incremental. Making `emit` incremental means knowing which
files' edges can change when one file's registry contribution changes — which
is a design, not a patch, and #2649 rules out "just cache the emitted edges".

## Measured and rejected

Recorded because each cost real time to establish and each looks attractive
from the armchair.

**More workers buys nothing.** Isolated-harness wall time at 16 / 20 / 24
workers: 44.1s / 44.8s / 43.3s — a 1.5s spread against a 3.7s within-size
spread. A full-analyze sweep appeared to show 20 beating 16 by 6.3s; it was
noise, and the sweep was invalid anyway because `GITNEXUS_WORKER_POOL_SIZE` was
silently clamped at the time (fixed in #3200). `DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE_CAP = 16`
stands.

**Bundling the worker entry buys ~250ms.** Worker boot profiled at 12.2s per
worker, of which `getPackageScopeConfig` 5.86s + `internalModuleStat` 3.14s +
`lstat`/`open` ~2.2s — ESM module resolution, not native grammars (all 11
`tree-sitter-*` imports together are 33ms) and not V8 compile (53ms;
`NODE_COMPILE_CACHE` gives zero gain). An esbuild bundle takes 16-worker boot
8.6s → 0.37s.

**That was a filesystem artifact.** On a normal overlay filesystem the same
boot is 515ms stock vs 263ms bundled — 0.2% of a 110s analyze. The 8.6s only
reproduces with the repo on a 9p mount (WSL2 `D:\`). Dropped.

Caveat carried by every number here: `dist` on a 9p mount costs ~3.5s of a 73s
run (73.0s vs 69.6s on overlay). Measure on a local filesystem.

---

## Open

The post-pipeline tail is fully accounted (99.7%): FTS rebuild, the graph write,
and 0.8s of post-FTS event-loop drain between them.

FTS is closed as an optimization target except for the overlap above, which is a
scheduling change to `run-analyze.ts`'s open/close discipline rather than
anything about FTS.

`scopeResolution` is now broken down. Its rehydration half has a floor and one
repeat-scan win that is taken. Its other half — `emit`, 7.2s — is the largest
remaining target in the whole edit loop, and the only way at it is incremental
resolution.

Every optimization in this document that looked compelling from the armchair
died under measurement. Measure first, and check the banner.
