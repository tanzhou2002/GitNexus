/**
 * Build-free scaling + identity bench for EVERY import-target resolver in
 * `SCOPE_RESOLVERS` — the registry decides which, not a list kept here, and the
 * `--check` inventory arm at the foot of this file fails when the two disagree
 * — over ONE shared corpus so the arms are directly comparable. One arm per
 * registered language, plus a second `csharp` arm carrying csproj configs
 * (#2902), so there is one more arm than there are languages. The newest row
 * is `zig` (PR #1432), added the day its resolver registered — the inventory
 * arm below is what noticed it missing, which is the arm doing its job.
 *
 * NO LANGUAGE IS OMITTED, and that is the point of the list rather than an
 * accident of it. Nine of these arms (go, csharp, csharp_csproj, dart, ruby,
 * kotlin, php, java, cobol) were added as their own O(imports × files) scans
 * were indexed away — #2877/#2878/#2879/#2880, #2872, #2901, #2902, #2908 — and
 * the bench is the forward guard on each. The eight added alongside them
 * (swift, rust, python, javascript, typescript, vue, c, cpp) resolve imports
 * through the same registered hook with the same per-run memoized indexes, and
 * were ungated: nothing pinned their output and nothing pinned their scaling.
 * One of them was not hypothetical — JavaScript reached `suffixResolve` with no
 * index at all and measured 25 972 µs per import at 8000 files (PR #2911) —
 * which is exactly the class of defect the other seven were one commit away
 * from.
 *
 * A C or C++ `#include` is an import site for this purpose and is gated like
 * every other registered language. See `newPass` for the one structural thing
 * those two need that no other language does.
 *
 * Kotlin also has `bench/kotlin-import-target/`, and this does not replace it:
 * that bench probes declared-package correctness cases shape by shape. What
 * Kotlin gains here is a second corpus plus shared timing, context and heap
 * arms.
 *
 * Each of the first nine resolvers answered its lookups with a full
 * `allFilePaths` scan per import before its fix, so import resolution cost
 * O(imports × files):
 *
 *   - Go: `findRootPackageFiles` / `findAllFilesInPkgDir`, the latter once per
 *     path segment on the GOPATH fallback — several full scans per import;
 *   - C#: the no-csproj leg took the raw Set past the memoized index the csproj
 *     leg was already using — up to eight passes for a four-segment `using`;
 *   - Dart: one full scan per candidate path, and for an external package both
 *     candidates miss, so both always ran to completion;
 *   - Ruby: a complete `buildSuffixIndex` rebuilt and discarded per `require`;
 *   - PHP: two materialized arrays per import and then no index at all, which
 *     dropped `suffixResolve` onto a linear `findIndex` — one full pass per path
 *     part per extension, and there are ~50 extensions (96.40 ms per import at
 *     20k files, now 0.036 ms);
 *   - Java: one scan for the direct match plus one more per stripped package
 *     prefix, and a JDK or third-party import runs the loop to the end (8.05 ms
 *     per import, now 0.62 ms);
 *   - COBOL: two scans per `COPY` — one per extension tier — each calling
 *     `extname` + `basename` + `toUpperCase` on every path, both always running
 *     to completion because vendor copybooks live outside the repo (3879 µs per
 *     import, now 10.5 µs);
 *   - C# csproj: the namespace-directory fallback re-scanned
 *     `normalizedFileList` per import per matching config (1103 µs, now 7.6 µs).
 *     `csharp` here builds its context with NO `csharpConfigs`, so it can never
 *     reach that leg — `csharp_csproj` is the same corpus with the configs
 *     supplied, and it exists because without it #2902 ships unmeasured.
 *
 * The eight added afterwards are not a second class of arm — they carry the
 * same five timing arms, the same per-scale fingerprint and shape gates and the
 * same budgets. What differs is what each one's cost is a function of, because
 * that decides which arm can actually fail for it:
 *
 *   - swift: `getSwiftModuleIndex` buckets a file under EVERY interior
 *     directory segment, so `Sources/Models/User.swift` answers to `Sources`
 *     and to `Models`. A miss is a Map miss and flat; a HIT returns the whole
 *     module bucket minus the importer, so its cost is the BUCKET size. Nothing
 *     in the unique layout produces a large bucket, which is why its collide
 *     arm is four modules instead of `dirs` of them (`SWIFT_COLLIDE_MODULES`);
 *     measured 3.28 there against 0.90 on file count.
 *   - rust: probes candidate paths with `allFilePaths.has(...)` and never
 *     searches, so its cost is O(path SEGMENTS) and is provably flat in the
 *     file count — measured 1.10 scaling, 1.06 collide scaling. That flatness
 *     IS the assertion, and it is why its collide arm is a deep module tree
 *     with ~2x the `::` segments rather than a shared-leaf layout: a collide
 *     arm built on file count would have been an arm that cannot fail. Note
 *     that `buildRustModuleIndex` lives on a DIFFERENT hook
 *     (`qualified-call.ts::moduleIndexFor`) and is not on this path at all.
 *   - python: `getPythonFileIndex` is keyed and flat on both file count and
 *     bucket cardinality (1.11 / 1.10), but `hasRepoCandidate` and
 *     `resolveAbsoluteFromFiles` each rebuild one ancestor prefix per directory
 *     component of the IMPORTER, so per-import cost is quadratic in path depth:
 *     measured depth_ratio 7.39, by far the largest here, and the reason its
 *     depth budget is 11 rather than the ~2 most languages carry.
 *   - javascript, typescript, vue: one resolver (`resolveTsModule`) behind
 *     three adapters, so the three corpora are the same shape and differ only
 *     in what actually differs — the extension list (`.js` vs `.ts`) and which
 *     config leg the arm exercises (`tsBaseUrlConfig` vs `vueTsconfig`). All
 *     three are miss-dominated bare specifiers.
 *
 *     What they measure CHANGED with #2953. The leg used to be `suffixResolve`,
 *     a repo-wide search for a path ending in the specifier; these three no
 *     longer have it, and resolve only against a declared tsconfig mapping or a
 *     package manifest. Two consequences the numbers show:
 *
 *       - the arms need a `resolutionConfig` to resolve anything at all. With
 *         none they all reported `resolved: 0` — every import correctly
 *         external — while still printing a clean scaling ratio, which is a
 *         bench measuring an empty branch and passing exactly like one
 *         measuring a full one.
 *       - `depth_ratio` is now structurally flat for them, and that is the
 *         result rather than a weakened arm: declared resolution never walks
 *         path components, so the `deep` arm's uniform prefix reaches the
 *         config (see `tsBaseUrlFor`) and its cost is the same keyed lookup the
 *         other arms pay.
 *   - c, cpp: quoted includes walk a basename bucket (depth, then lexicographic).
 *     The collide arm — a `mod{n}` header in every service's `include/` — is
 *     where that walk grows: 2.54 / 2.64 against 1.06 on file count. Each
 *     language keeps its own bucket memo. Angle includes join the target onto
 *     header search paths and never take that walk. The timing corpus passes
 *     a raw header set and no `isSystem` flag, so it stays on the quoted path.
 *     `--check` also resolves a quoted hit, an angle hit on a declared include
 *     root, and an angle miss against a same-named `src/` decoy.
 *   - zig: `resolveZigImportInternal` is rust's shape — an `@import("…zig")`
 *     path is walked component by component from the importer's directory and
 *     probed with two `allFiles.has(...)` calls (as written, then `+ '.zig'`),
 *     and a bare name is a Map lookup in the build config or a miss. No index
 *     is built, so the cost is O(path SEGMENTS) and flat in the file count,
 *     and — as for rust — its collide arm is a deep tree whose spellings carry
 *     ~4x the components rather than a shared-leaf layout that cannot fail.
 *     The arm passes NO build config (`buildZon` null): the bare-name legs
 *     (`b.addModule` roots, zon `.path` deps) read `build.zig` / `build.zig.zon`
 *     through `loadZigBuildConfig` and are gated by
 *     `test/unit/zig-import-resolver.test.ts`, so this fingerprint pins the
 *     path-walking resolver alone and does not move when that config parsing
 *     changes.
 *
 * Two properties of the corpus are load-bearing and must not be "simplified":
 *
 *  1. **Most imports are unresolvable.** In real source the majority of imports
 *     name the stdlib or a third-party package, and those run every leg of the
 *     cascade to completion before returning null — the fast paths never fire.
 *     A corpus of mostly-resolving imports measures the wrong half of the
 *     function and would score a reintroduced scan as linear.
 *  2. **Import count scales WITH file count.** The regression is quadratic in
 *     `imports × files`; holding imports fixed while files grow would halve the
 *     exponent and let a per-import scan pass the budget.
 *
 * Reports per language and scale:
 *   - `ms`: fastest of REPS full passes, INCLUDING the one-time index build —
 *     hiding the build would let an index that is itself quadratic pass;
 *   - `scaling_ratio` `(t_large/t_small)/(LARGE/SMALL)`: ~1.0 linear, ~4.x
 *     quadratic at this scale gap;
 *   - `depth_ratio` `t_deep/t_small` at a FIXED file count with ~6x the path
 *     components. `scaling_ratio` divides the file count out, so it is
 *     scale-invariant and structurally cannot see a cost that grows with path
 *     DEPTH instead — and `buildSuffixIndex` (C#, Ruby, PHP, Java) emits one
 *     entry per component. Go, Dart, Kotlin and COBOL have depth-free indexes
 *     (COBOL's are keyed on the basename and nothing else), so they sit near
 *     1.0; the suffix-indexed resolvers sit legitimately above 1.0,
 *     which is why the budget is per language. Python is the extreme and the
 *     reason the spread is worth a per-language number at all: its index is
 *     depth-free, but `hasRepoCandidate` and `resolveAbsoluteFromFiles` rebuild
 *     an ancestor prefix per importer directory component ON EVERY IMPORT, so
 *     the RESOLVER, not the index, is quadratic in depth — 7.39;
 *   - `collide_scaling_ratio`, the same measurement on a corpus whose
 *     directories SHARE their last segment and whose files share basenames —
 *     see the `collide` section below;
 *   - `heap` (all 17): retained bytes of the per-pass import index, read by
 *     resolving one real import — see the `heap` section below. Eight carry a
 *     ceiling, a floor and a ratio; the other nine carry an upper bound only;
 *   - a sha256 over every distinct `fromFile | target → result`, as the
 *     correctness gate. The tie-break-level proof that this PR's index
 *     reproduces the scans lives in
 *     `test/unit/scope-resolution/import-target-index-parity.test.ts`, which
 *     diffs against verbatim copies of the pre-change implementations; this
 *     fingerprint is the forward guard that keeps the output pinned from here.
 *     Every scale's fingerprint is asserted, not just `large`'s: the arms
 *     differ only in layout and padding, so a per-scale-only defect (a resolver
 *     bug that corrupts deep paths, or a corpus edit that quietly deletes the
 *     depth padding) moves no asserted count and would otherwise print PASS.
 *
 * `--check` adds arms that no ratio can carry:
 *   - the corpus SHAPE (files, imports, resolved, distinct outcomes, per scale),
 *     so a future edit cannot quietly shrink the corpus below the sizes that
 *     make the timing arms meaningful and still print PASS. The `deep` and
 *     `collide` arms must also resolve exactly what `small` resolves — padding
 *     and re-layout were supposed to change path depth and directory naming and
 *     nothing else;
 *   - `deep.fingerprint !== small.fingerprint` and
 *     `collide.fingerprint !== small.fingerprint`, so those two arms' EFFECT is
 *     pinned rather than only their output. Both are count-neutral by
 *     construction, so neutering either one (`DEEP_PAD = 0`, a `collideDir`
 *     that forwards to `uniqueDir`) leaves every asserted number untouched;
 *     comparing the arms to `small` is the only thing that notices;
 *   - `small_ms_ceiling` and `collide_ms_ceiling`, ABSOLUTE bounds, because a
 *     constant-factor regression that grows both scale arms equally passes
 *     every ratio;
 *   - a heap FLOOR beside every heap ceiling, and a presence check in front of
 *     every timing budget. Both exist because the same failure has now happened
 *     twice in this file's short life: an arm that stops measuring passes. A
 *     lazy `buildSuffixIndex` made four heap arms read 0 B, and 0 B is under
 *     every ceiling; a deleted budget key makes `got > undefined` false, which
 *     is a deleted gate wearing a passing arm's clothes;
 *   - an INVENTORY arm against `SCOPE_RESOLVERS` itself. `LANG_REGISTRY` claims
 *     to cover every registered resolver; this is what makes the claim true
 *     rather than commented, and it is the arm that would have caught PR #2911's
 *     language shipping unmeasured.
 *
 * SCOPE OF THE "independent of corpus size" CLAIM — the `collide` arm.
 * `small`/`large`/`deep` mint one directory name per index (`src/pkg7`,
 * `src/Ns7`, `lib/feature7`) and one basename per file, so every index bucket
 * in them holds exactly ONE entry: measured, max last-segment bucket = 1 and
 * max matching directories = 1 for go and csharp at both 400 and 1600 files,
 * max basename bucket = 1 for dart and ruby. Bucket cardinality is the only
 * non-constant term the new indexes have, so those arms certify the headline
 * claim on the one shape where that term cannot appear. `collide` is the same
 * workload — identical file, import and resolved counts — laid out the way
 * these languages are actually written: `svcN/internal/`, `SrcN/Models/`, a
 * `mod0.dart`/`mod0.rb` in every package. Measured on that shape the per-import
 * cost is NOT corpus-size-independent for the three resolvers that scan a
 * bucket:
 *
 *   - go, csharp and java walk `PackageDirIndex.dirsByLastSegment[seg]`, which
 *     now holds every directory;
 *   - dart formerly walked its basename bucket. Since #2963 its package-URI
 *     arms use exact declared-package paths; the separate heap probe and
 *     scan-count regressions still exercise its relative-path suffix index;
 *   - ruby, kotlin, php and cobol answer from keyed maps and are collision-
 *     IMMUNE, so their collide budgets are the linear ones — that immunity is
 *     the assertion, and for cobol the arm is also the only one that reaches
 *     the copybook-over-source tier tie-break, which needs one bookname to name
 *     two files;
 *   - csharp_csproj runs the OTHER way: its shared leaf collapses
 *     `dirsByLastSegment` to a single key, which makes the slash-free sweep
 *     (see `CSPROJ_CONFIGS`) cheaper on the collide layout than on the unique
 *     one, so its expensive scale arm is `large`, not `collide_large`;
 *   - of the eight added later, swift (3.28) and c/cpp (2.54/2.64) are the two
 *     that scan a bucket, and they scan DIFFERENT buckets: swift's is the
 *     module's own file list, which it returns, and C's is the basename bucket
 *     its suffix fallback walks. python answers from keyed maps and sits at
 *     1.03-1.10, and javascript, typescript and vue answer from a declared
 *     config (#2953) — so all four keep the linear budget and that immunity is
 *     their assertion, exactly as for ruby and kotlin;
 *   - rust's collide arm is the one that is NOT a shared-leaf layout, and the
 *     reason is in the list above: file count is not an axis its cost has, so a
 *     shared-leaf rust arm would have been an arm that cannot fail. Its collide
 *     corpus is a deep module tree whose targets carry ~2x the `::` segments,
 *     which is the axis that CAN grow; the ratio across file counts staying at
 *     1.06 on it is the assertion, and `collide_ms_ceiling` bounds the absolute
 *     cost of the long-path probe. zig's collide arm is built the same way and
 *     for the same reason: a deep tree whose `../../…/l4/mod{n}/file.zig`
 *     spellings walk ~4x the components of the unique arm's `../mod{n}/…`.
 *
 * This is a scope-of-claim limit, not a regression: on the MISS path with a
 * shared leaf name the bucket grows with the file count BY CONSTRUCTION, and
 * the indexed code is still faster there than the pre-change full scan. The arm
 * exists so the real shape is measured and pinned, and so nobody reads the 1.8
 * budget as covering it. Narrowing it would mean a reversed-path prefix-range
 * structure, which trades against the O(files × depth) memory
 * `package-dir-index.ts` cites #2649 to avoid — a design change, not a tune.
 *
 * MEMORY — the `heap` arm. C#, Ruby, PHP and Java all resolve through the
 * shared `WorkspaceFileIndex`, and `buildSuffixIndex` under it emits maps at
 * O(files × depth): exactly the profile `package-dir-index.ts` cites #2649 to
 * avoid for itself. That is why this is gated rather than noted — all four
 * retained NOTHING across imports at BASE. C#'s `getWorkspaceFileIndex` was
 * reached only from the csproj branch while the no-csproj leg scanned the Set;
 * PHP and Java scanned on every leg; Ruby rebuilt and discarded a suffix index
 * per `require`. Every other arm here is time or count, and no ratio can see a
 * footprint. Measured in ABSOLUTE bytes, not only as a ratio: the finding is
 * about the footprint itself, and a ratio alone hides a large constant.
 *
 * Four more are gated for the same reason as those four. JavaScript is the
 * clearest case in the file: before PR #2911 it retained NOTHING because it
 * built no index at all, and it now retains 25.51 MiB at 32 000 files through
 * the
 * same `buildSuffixIndex`. `csharp_csproj` is the newest and the one that
 * proves the arm's design: same corpus and same `getWorkspaceFileIndex` as
 * `csharp`, but its csproj leg asks all three questions instead of one, and it
 * retains 70.29 MiB against C#'s 28.48. Python's `getPythonFileIndex`
 * (9.88 MiB) and C's basename map (9.55 MiB) are an order of magnitude smaller
 * but are the only structure either language keeps, and both are one careless
 * edit — a stored `split('/')` array instead of a depth NUMBER — away from the
 * O(files × depth) shape this arm exists to catch.
 *
 * WHAT THE ARM MEASURES IS NOW THE READ PATTERN, and that is the correction
 * this file most needed. `buildSuffixIndex`'s two suffix maps became lazy
 * (#2903 extended past `dirMap`), and the four original arms — which called
 * `getWorkspaceFileIndex(set)` directly and read `index.all.length` — stopped
 * asking any suffix question, built no map, and reported 0 B at 32 000 files.
 * 0 B is under every ceiling, so `--check` PASSED with four gates that had
 * become ceilings over nothing. Every arm now resolves one real MISSING import
 * through the real resolver, so the maps it forces are the maps production
 * forces; `HEAP_PROBE_TARGET` and `retainedPassBytes` carry the details, and
 * `heap_floor_fraction` is the gate that would have caught the 0 B.
 *
 * EVERY LANGUAGE IS MEASURED, and the eight-entry list this arm ran on is now
 * the BUDGET tier rather than the measurement tier. That list — `HEAP_LANGS`,
 * now `HEAP_BUDGETED` — was reconciled bidirectionally against its two budget
 * maps and every entry had to produce a reading, but nothing tied it to the
 * property it stood for, "the languages that retain a per-pass index". Its two
 * neighbours in this file do not have that gap: `LANG_REGISTRY` is reconciled
 * against `SCOPE_RESOLVERS.keys()` and `CONTEXT_LANGS` against hook arity, both
 * directions, both derived. Nine languages were excluded on readings taken once
 * and written into this prose, and the paragraph below states the re-entry
 * condition ("if any of the four ever diverges in what it ASKS, it earns an arm
 * the same way") with nothing watching for the divergence.
 *
 * Re-measured — all seventeen, five runs each, one probe per language through
 * the same `retainedPassBytes` — the prose was wrong in three separate ways:
 *
 *   1. THREE OF THE NINE HAD NO STATED REASON AT ALL. The old paragraph opened
 *      "SIX of the seventeen are deliberately NOT in HEAP_LANGS" against a list
 *      of eight, so go, dart and kotlin were excluded silently. All three
 *      retain a real per-pass structure: go's `PackageDirIndex` reads
 *      2 998 464 B, dart's basename buckets 7 834 200 B, and kotlin's
 *      `suffixByStem` cascade 42 802 456 B (40.82 MiB) — above ruby's 39.12 and
 *      java's 33.34, both of which carry a full budget. (Read 48 073 096 B when
 *      this paragraph was written and described as "the second-largest reading
 *      in this file", which it was not even then: csharp_csproj and php both
 *      read higher. #2881 then compacted kotlin's `dirChildren` buckets and
 *      took 11% off it.)
 *   2. TWO OF THE STATED REASONS NO LONGER HOLD. swift was excluded as "below
 *      its own noise floor" on 0.98 MB at 8000 files against 0.29 MB at 32 000;
 *      it now reads 969 120 B and 3 449 216 B, growing the right way. COBOL was
 *      excluded "for the same reason" on 0.54 MB then 0 B; it now reads
 *      536 264 B and 2 320 456 B, ratio 1.082. Neither number moved because
 *      either index changed — the ARM changed, twice, when it started resolving
 *      a real import (#2903) and when `measureHeap` began flattening its
 *      corpus. Both re-measure to within 0.24% peak-to-peak over five runs,
 *      which is not a noise floor.
 *   3. THE PROSE HAD GONE STALE AGAINST ITSELF. It quoted javascript at
 *      46 208 832 B four paragraphs after quoting it at 25.51 MiB
 *      (26 745 296 B), because one number was re-taken with the arm and the
 *      other was only ever written down.
 *
 * Only rust's exclusion survived unchanged: 16 B at 8000 files and 16 B at
 * 32 000, identical in all five runs, because it probes candidate paths with
 * `allFilePaths.has(...)` and builds nothing. zig joined that tier on the same
 * reading for the same reason (`resolveZigImportInternal` holds no per-pass
 * structure at all), and takes rust's absolute 1 MiB bound.
 *
 * So the nine are still not BUDGETED — their ceilings, floors and ratio arms
 * are not this change to write — but they are all measured and all bounded. See
 * `HEAP_BOUNDED` for the gate and `_heap_bound_note` in baselines.json for each
 * language's reading and its own reason, which are not one reason: rust builds
 * nothing; go, dart, kotlin, swift and cobol build something this file has
 * never bounded; and typescript, vue and cpp are duplicates of a BUILDER and of
 * a READ PATTERN, both halves of which have to hold — `csharp_csproj` was
 * excluded on the first half alone, at +20.8% of the C# index, and reads 2.47x
 * of it now that the second half decides the number. Measured here: typescript
 * 26 745 296 B against javascript's 26 745 296 B (byte-identical in four runs
 * of five), cpp 10 023 344 B against c's 10 018 816 B (+0.05%), vue
 * 28 884 016 B (+8.0%, what `.vue` instead of `.ts` buys on two thirds of the
 * paths). The bound is what watches for the divergence the re-entry condition
 * names — and it watches at 1.5x, so it catches a language GROWING an index,
 * not a duplicate drifting by 8%. That limit is stated rather than papered
 * over: the tight form is a same-process ratio against the arm each one
 * duplicates, which is the only form immune to the cross-runner heapUsed drift
 * an absolute bound has to tolerate.
 *
 * KNOWN BLIND SPOT, measured: a full workspace scan reintroduced on 1-in-32
 * imports passes every arm here (dart scored 1.458 scaling, 1.736 ms). The gate
 * that NARROWS it is not a timing gate — the parity test above counts
 * iterations of the file-set Set and reads 14 instead of 1 for that same
 * mutation. It does not CLOSE it: the counter watches the Set, while the
 * resolvers hold materialized arrays of the same file list
 * (`WorkspaceFileIndex.normalized`/`.all`, Dart's basename buckets,
 * `PackageDirIndex.filesByDir`, PHP's `filesByRawDirectory`, COBOL's two tier
 * maps), and a 1-in-32 scan over one of THOSE passes
 * both the parity test and `--check`. Chasing it by tightening these ceilings
 * toward the noise floor would only buy flaky CI; see `_blind_spot` in
 * baselines.json. PR #2911 is the proof that this blind spot is real rather
 * than theoretical: JavaScript's missing index was a scan of
 * `ImportPassCache.normalizedFileList` on EVERY import, which the Set counter
 * could not see, and it took a differential parity test over 211 200 pairs plus
 * this bench's arrival to pin it.
 *
 * THE FIFTH ARGUMENT — `context`, and exactly how much of it is measured. This
 * harness used to call the inner resolvers with THREE arguments while `run.ts`
 * calls `provider.resolveImportTarget` with FIVE, the fifth being
 * `{ parsedFiles, parsedImport }`. Every arm was therefore a measurement of a
 * call shape production never makes, and that is not a cheap thing to get
 * wrong: defeating the `perFileSet` memo behind PHP's `filesByDirectory`
 * measures 197.0 µs -> 9976.2 µs per import (50.6x) with every test still
 * green, and nothing here could see it.
 *
 * `resolveOne` now makes the production call. Four of the seventeen arms can
 * observe it — PHP, Java, Kotlin and Python declare a fifth parameter — and
 * that is ASSERTED rather than asserted-in-a-comment: the
 * inventory arm at the foot of the file reads
 * `SCOPE_RESOLVERS.get(language).resolveImportTarget.length` and reconciles it
 * against `CONTEXT_LANGS` in both directions, so a language that grows a
 * context leg cannot ship with the leg unmeasured. The other thirteen are handed
 * nothing and build no `ParsedFile[]` at all, so their numbers are unmoved.
 *
 * `newPass` mints the `ParsedFile[]` FIRST and derives the path set from it
 * (`new Set(parsedFiles.map(f => f.filePath))`), because that is what `run.ts`
 * does — two independently built lists are a shape the pipeline cannot produce
 * and would let the two memos disagree about which files exist. Both are fresh
 * per pass for the reason the Set always was: `filesByDirectory` (PHP) and
 * `parsedFileByPath` (Python) are `perFileSet` memos keyed on the ARRAY's
 * identity, so a reused array would hide their build from rep 2 onward and
 * `fastest()` takes the minimum.
 *
 * THE LEGS ACTUALLY RUN, which is what a "context is threaded" claim is worth
 * nothing without — a leg that returns early measures nothing, the exact
 * failure the four 0 B heap arms already demonstrated in this file. PHP's needs
 * `parsedImport.kind` to be `named` or `alias` AND `importedSymbolKind` to be
 * `function` or `const`; Python's needs a `named`/`alias` import too, because
 * the synthetic `namespace` spelling this file used to pass makes
 * `pythonImportedSubmoduleTarget` return null and `context.parsedFiles` is then
 * never read at all. A deterministic `context` arm pins both per language: a
 * three-file corpus resolved through `resolveOne` twice, once with the pass's
 * `parsedFiles` and once without, whose two answers must DIFFER and must both
 * equal what baselines.json records. Dropping the fifth argument, dropping
 * `importedSymbolKind`, or reverting Python to `namespace` collapses the two
 * onto one value and fails. PHP and Python still agree with their fallback on
 * the main corpus; Java and Kotlin deliberately have no context-free fallback,
 * so their fingerprints pin the declared-package answers recorded here.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT MEASURED, narrowed rather than deleted:
 *
 *   - Python's `parsedFileByPath` memo is exercised by the five timing arms and
 *     NOT by the heap arm, and structurally cannot be. `retainedPassBytes`
 *     requires its probe to MISS, while every path that builds that memo runs
 *     through a non-null `packageTarget` which `resolvePythonImportTarget` then
 *     returns. So nothing here bounds that Map's footprint; it is one pointer
 *     per parsed file, O(files) with no depth term, and the count gate in
 *     import-target-index-reuse.contract.test.ts is what holds it to one build
 *     per pass;
 *   - PHP runs with the Composer PSR-4 configuration every production project
 *     supplies. Configured hits and unmatched dependency misses share one
 *     workload, so the Composer gate cannot become an unmeasured fast path;
 *   - the `const` tail of PHP's leg (`candidateFiles.length === 1`) is a
 *     different ANSWER, not a different cost: `function` runs the identical
 *     candidate gather and `localDefs` filter and diverges only in the last two
 *     lines. It is gated by count in the contract test above.
 *
 * COST, and the honest version of it. REPORT mode is ~33-35 s, down from ~46 s:
 * the timing phase fell from 39.8 s to 28.7 s when `REPS` became per-language
 * (see `repsFor`), and that win is real. `--check` is ~44-45 s, which is
 * ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED from the ~46 s it cost before, because the inventory
 * arm added here loads `pipeline/registry.ts` and that one dynamic import
 * consumes almost the whole `repsFor` win — measured 6.3-6.5 s on one box and
 * 9.3-10.0 s on another, in isolation and after this file's own static imports
 * are already resident. Do not read the two modes as "~46 → ~42": only report
 * mode got faster.
 *
 * MEASURING ALL SEVENTEEN HEAP ARMS instead of eight costs 1.37 s, and that is
 * a measured number rather than the "seconds are free here" the paragraph below
 * would have let it be. Timed per language with the phase instrumented, twice:
 * the heap phase goes 2.06 s -> 3.43 s (1.377 s and 1.370 s added over the two
 * runs). Those figures predate #2960: Kotlin now retains a compact
 * declared-package/module-binding index rather than three path-suffix maps.
 * End to end
 * that is report mode 33.76 s -> 34.93 s (min of three runs each, +1.17 s,
 * consistent with the phase measurement inside run-to-run noise). `--check` was
 * 41.60 s before and reads 41.48-43.56 s after, i.e. the whole-run difference
 * is INSIDE the registry import's own 6.3-10.0 s spread and cannot be resolved
 * at that level — the +1.37 s phase number is the one to quote.
 *
 * That cost was weighed and KEPT, on the one number that decides it: the
 * `benchmarks` job is not CI's critical path. On the last green run of main it
 * finished in 9 m 23 s against 12 m 58 s for the sharded coverage job that
 * gates the merge, so ~4 m 40 s of slack sits above this bench and ten seconds
 * of it buys zero merge latency. Moving the arm into a vitest file would move
 * the registry load ONTO that critical path, and would weaken it besides: from
 * `LANG_REGISTRY`'s `SupportedLanguages` values, which are what the five
 * dispatcher branches key off, down to baselines.json's arm NAMES plus a
 * hand-written rule for de-aliasing `csharp_csproj`. See the wall-clock note in
 * `_arms_note` for the per-language breakdown and for what to drop first if
 * that stops fitting the job.

 * The per-pass state one resolver sees: the file set it is handed, and the

 * in `import-resolvers/per-file-set.ts` is keyed on that object's identity, so
 * reusing one Set across passes would hide the index build after the first and
 * let a rebuilt-per-import index look free from rep 2 onward.
 *
 * `config` is why this exists as a function rather than a `new Set(files)` at
 * three call sites. Three languages here need one and they need three different
 * things:
 *
 *  - C and C++ take their HEADERS through `resolutionConfig`, not through
 *    `allFilePaths`. The phase hands the C resolver the `.c` files it
 *    classified and the header scan separately, and
 *    `augmentedFilePathsFor(allFilePaths)(headerPaths)` unions the two ONCE per
 *    pass — a two-input memo, so both inputs have to be pass-stable or it
 *    rebuilds an O(files) Set per include. Splitting the corpus here is what
 *    makes that union reachable at all; handing the resolver one pre-merged set
 *    would leave the memo, and the shape it exists for, unmeasured.
 *  - Vue takes `tsconfigPaths`, and the alias branch is the one leg of the
 *    shared ts-family resolver its arm covers that the other two do not.
 *
 * `csharp_csproj` is the precedent and stays where it is: a per-language
 * CONTEXT over a corpus aliased to another language's, rather than a new axis.
 *
 * `parsedFiles` is the third pass-stable object. `newPass` builds it for the
 * `CONTEXT_LANGS` members that are not header languages, and leaves it
 * undefined otherwise — C and C++ are in that list but return on
 * `HEADER_EXTENSION` first, so a timed pass does not allocate the array.
 * Where it is built, it is built BEFORE the path set and the path
 * set is derived FROM it, which is not a stylistic choice: `run.ts` does
 * `new Set(parsedFiles.map((f) => f.filePath))`, so two independently built
 * lists would be a shape the pipeline cannot produce. Fresh per pass for
 * exactly the reason the Set is — `filesByDirectory` and `parsedFileByPath` are
 * `perFileSet` memos keyed on this ARRAY's identity, so reusing one array would
 * hide their build from rep 2 onward and `fastest()` reports the minimum.

 * Retained JS heap of everything one language derives from one file set —

 * `getWorkspaceFileIndex(set)` directly and read `index.all.length`, which asks
 * no suffix question at all. That was harmless only while `buildSuffixIndex`
 * built both maps eagerly. The moment they went lazy the direct call built NO
 * map, all four arms reported 0 B at 32 000 files, and 0 B is under every
 * ceiling — four gates silently became ceilings over nothing, which is exactly
 * the failure this file's header warns about for rust and cobol. Driving the
 * real resolver cannot fail that way: whatever maps the language forces are the
 * maps it forces in production, and if a resolver starts asking a new question
 * the number moves on its own instead of needing this file edited.
 *
 * It also happens to be the only form available for half of these languages —
 * Swift's `getSwiftModuleIndex`, Python's `getPythonFileIndex`, C's
 * `suffixIndex` and the ts-family `passCacheFor` are private to their modules,
 * and exporting four builders to feed a bench would widen four module surfaces
 * for a measurement's convenience. Now that all eight arms use one form, the
 * readings ARE comparable to one another (they were not before).
 *
 * GROWTH form, not the release form `bench/cfg/measure.mjs` uses: every index
 * here is memoized in a `WeakMap` keyed on the Set, so releasing it means
 * releasing the Set too, which would fold the Set's own cost into the delta.
 * Here the pass is live across BOTH samples and the `files` array holds the
 * path strings, so the delta is the derived structures' own footprint and not
 * the paths they point at. For C and C++ it legitimately includes the augmented
 * Set, which is part of what they hold; for every language it includes the one

/**
 * TIER TWO, the bounded arms: ONE comparison, and what it is a comparison FOR.
 *
 * `heap_bound_bytes` is the "exclusion still holds" bound. It does not claim
 * these indexes are small enough, which is what a ceiling claims about a
 * budgeted one; it claims each is still the SIZE the decision to leave it out
 * was taken on. `HEAP_BOUNDED` derives to SEVEN today — cobol, swift, rust,
 * the ts family (#2953), and zig, which reads what rust reads (16 B) because
 * `resolveZigImportInternal` builds nothing and takes rust's absolute bound.
 * The prose below still counts nine because six were promoted to tier one
 * after it was written; read the counts as history, and `HEAP_BOUNDED` itself
 * as the answer. The re-entry condition the MEMORY section states — "if any of
 * the four ever diverges in what it ASKS, it earns an arm the same way" — is a
 * claim about growth, and this is the only thing in the file that can see it.
 *
 * NO FLOOR, and the reason is per language rather than uniform. rust (and zig)
 * reads 16 B because it builds nothing, so any floor at all would be a floor
 * on noise and `1.5 x 0 B` is 0 — its bound is ABSOLUTE (1 MiB) for the same
 * reason: a multiplier on 16 B fails on the first byte of anything. The other eight are
 * stable enough today to floor (0.24% peak-to-peak at worst over five runs).
 * The two this paragraph named as floor candidates, kotlin and dart, TOOK that
 * promotion: both now carry a ceiling and a recorded reading in tier one, which
 * is what the paragraph said the promotion had to be. What this tier is NOT is a
 * weaker version of tier one — it is a different question, asked of the
 * languages tier one does not ask it of.
