// Evict a slot judged stale from the `inspected` stat. A slot file is only
// ever deleted, never moved, and only by the evictor holding the per-slot
// `<slot>.evicting` marker, created O_EXCL with a token unique to this call.
// Every destructive step verifies first:
//  - the slot is unlinked only if the marker still carries our token (an
//    evictor stalled long enough for its marker to be broken as an orphan has
//    lost its claim and backs off) and the slot is still the exact file
//    inspected — identical dev/ino/size/mtimeNs means its content and age are
//    unchanged, so the stale verdict still holds, while a slot recreated since
//    inspection fails the check and its lock stands;
//  - our marker is removed only if it still carries our token, so a marker
//    that has passed to another claimant is left alone;
//  - an orphaned marker is broken only if it is still the old file it was
//    judged to be (see breakOrphanedMarker).
//
// Residual windows. POSIX has no conditional unlink, so each check-then-
// unlink pair keeps a gap of two adjacent syscalls:
//  (a) Slot: between the lstat identity check and unlinkSync(slot), a live
//      owner past HOOK_LOCK_STALE_MS could release and a new hook recreate the
//      slot, whose fresh lock would then be deleted. The consequence is at
//      most one extra concurrent augment beyond HOOK_LOCK_MAX_INFLIGHT for
//      that run — the cap is a load guard, and no data or index state
//      depends on it. The victim's release() sees a foreign or missing file
//      and leaves it alone.
//  (b) Marker: between the token re-read and unlinkSync(marker) (ours or an
//      orphan's), the marker could pass to another claimant, whose claim would
//      then be removed. That only re-opens the slot to one more evictor, which
//      still has to pass the slot identity check before deleting anything.
// Both need a stall of seconds landing on that exact syscall pair, and the
// only thing lost is one run's cap accounting, so they are accepted rather
// than traded for heavier machinery. A crash at any point orphans at most the
// marker, which the next contender breaks after it expires.
