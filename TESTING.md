# Testing — GitNexus

How we structure tests and which commands to run locally and in CI.

## Packages

| Package        | Path            | Runner     | Notes                      |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| CLI + MCP core | `gitnexus/`     | Vitest     | Primary test surface in CI |
| Web UI         | `gitnexus-web/` | Vitest     | Unit/component tests       |
| Web UI E2E     | `gitnexus-web/` | Playwright | Run when changing UI flows |

## Test lanes

### `gitnexus/` commands

From `gitnexus/`:

| Command                       | What it runs                                       | When to use                           |

### `gitnexus-web/` commands

From `gitnexus-web/`:

| Command                 | What it runs                  | When to use                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm test`              | Unit/component tests (vitest) | After changing web code                                             |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Unit tests + coverage         | Checking coverage impact                                            |
| `npm run test:e2e`      | Playwright browser tests      | After changing UI flows (requires `gitnexus serve` + `npm run dev`) |

### Before opening a PR

```bash
# gitnexus-shared/dist must exist first. `npm install` / `npm run build` in
# gitnexus/ compiles it via parent `lib/tsc.js` (do not npm ci gitnexus-shared).
cd gitnexus && npx tsc --noEmit && npm test
cd ../gitnexus-web && npx tsc -b --noEmit && npm test
```

## Pre-commit hook

A husky pre-commit hook (`.husky/pre-commit`) runs automatically on every `git commit`:

1. **Formatting** — `lint-staged` runs prettier on staged files
2. **`gitnexus-web/` files staged** → `tsc -b --noEmit`
3. **`gitnexus/` files staged** → `tsc --noEmit`

Tests do **not** run in the pre-commit hook — they run in CI (`ci-tests.yml`) only.

Skip with `git commit --no-verify` (use sparingly).

## Vitest projects

`gitnexus/vitest.config.ts` defines three projects for safety isolation:

| Project   | Files                                              | Parallelism | Purpose                                             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `lbug-db` | Native LadybugDB integration tests (explicit list) | Sequential  | Prevents file-lock conflicts from native mmap addon |
| `cli-e2e` | `skills-e2e.test.ts`                               | Sequential  | CLI process spawning requires serial execution      |
| `default` | Everything else                                    | Parallel    | Fast execution for pure logic and parser tests      |

When adding a new test that uses native LadybugDB (`@ladybugdb/core`), add it to the `lbug-db` project's explicit include list and the `default` project's exclude list.

## Test categories

- **Unit** — Pure logic, parsers, graph/query helpers; fast; no network.
- **Integration** — Real combinations (filesystem, MCP wiring, larger pipelines) as already organized under `gitnexus/test/integration`.
- **Resolver / parity** — Language-specific call-resolution tests in `test/integration/resolvers/`.
- **E2E (web)** — Critical user paths only; prefer `data-testid` attributes for stable selectors. Tests run against real backend (`gitnexus serve`) and Vite dev server.

## Scope-resolution tests

Every language resolves calls and inheritance through the scope-resolution pipeline — the legacy call-resolution DAG and the per-language `REGISTRY_PRIMARY_<LANG>` flag were removed in RING4-1 (#942). Each language's resolver test lives at `test/integration/resolvers/<slug>.test.ts` and runs once, on the single scope-resolution path, as part of the normal `tests` job (`vitest test/**/*.test.ts`).

Adding a language: register its `ScopeResolver` in `scope-resolution/pipeline/registry.ts` (`SCOPE_RESOLVERS`) and add the resolver test file — no workflow or config edit needed.

## Cross-platform testing

Windows and macOS CI runs only the platform-sensitive test subset (~50 files out of 373). The full suite runs on Ubuntu.

The subset is defined in `gitnexus/scripts/cross-platform-tests.ts` and includes:

- **Platform-specific logic** — tests with `process.platform` guards, path.sep behavior, EPERM/EBUSY error classification
- **Native LadybugDB** — all `lbug-*` integration tests (N-API addon with known platform-varying behavior)
- **Process spawning / CLI** — tests using real `child_process.spawn`, shell quoting, CLI invocations
- **Worker threads** — tests spawning real `worker_threads`
- **Native addon loading** — tree-sitter grammar loading smoke tests
- **Filesystem behavior** — CRLF handling, directory walking, symlinks

When adding a platform-sensitive test, add it to the appropriate section in `scripts/cross-platform-tests.ts`.

### Confirming no tests are orphaned

Every test file matches one of the three vitest projects. To verify:

```bash
cd gitnexus
npx vitest list 2>/dev/null | wc -l  # should match total test count
```

To check the cross-platform list is up to date, run `npm run test:cross-platform` — it fails fast if any listed file is missing.

## CI integration

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) orchestrate:

| Workflow              | Jobs                                                              | Purpose                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ci-quality.yml`      | format, lint, typecheck, typecheck-web, workflow-convention       | Code quality gates                                                    |
| `ci-tests.yml`        | ubuntu/coverage, cross-platform (Win/Mac), packaged-install-smoke | Full suite + coverage on Ubuntu; platform-sensitive subset on Win/Mac |
| `ci-scope-parity.yml` | discover, parity                                                  | Scope-resolution parity for all migrated languages                    |
| `ci-e2e.yml`          | e2e (chromium)                                                    | Playwright E2E, gated on `gitnexus-web/**` changes                    |

The `CI Gate` job in `ci.yml` is the single required check for branch protection. It requires quality, tests, e2e, and scope-parity to all pass.

## Regression testing

Re-run the full relevant suite when:

- Prompt or agent-behavior documentation changes (if tests encode behavior)
- Model or embedding-related code paths change
- Graph schema, query contracts, or MCP tool shapes change
- Dependencies with parsing or runtime impact upgrade

## User acceptance / beta (optional)

For staged releases or UI betas: deploy to a staging environment, collect structured feedback, watch errors and latency, then iterate before a wider release.
