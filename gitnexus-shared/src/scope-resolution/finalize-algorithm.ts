/**
 * `finalize` — cross-file finalize algorithm for the SemanticModel
 * (RFC §3.2 Phase 2; Ring 2 SHARED #915).
 *
 * Pure logic that takes per-file parse output (`ParsedImport[]` +
 * `SymbolDefinition[]`) and returns:
 *
 *   - Linked `ImportEdge[]` keyed by binding scope (`fromScope`; module
 *     scope unless `importsBindAtLexicalScope` is on), with
 *     `targetModuleScope` and `targetDefId` filled where resolvable; edges
 *     that could not be resolved within the hard fixpoint cap are marked
 *     `linkStatus: 'unresolved'`.
 *   - Materialized `bindings` keyed by the same scopes — local defs merged
 *     with imported / wildcard-expanded / re-exported names via the
 *     provider's `mergeBindings` precedence.
 *   - The SCC condensation of the import graph, exposed so disjoint SCCs
 *     can be processed in parallel by callers that want that.
 *
 * The algorithm is **SCC-aware**: it runs Tarjan SCC over the file-level
 * import graph, processes SCCs in reverse-topological order (leaves
 * first), and within each SCC runs a bounded fixpoint link pass capped at
 * `N = |edges in SCC|`. Cyclic imports finalize without hanging; malformed
 * inputs are bounded by the cap.
 *
 * **No language-specific logic.** Target resolution, wildcard expansion,
 * and binding precedence all go through caller-supplied hooks
 * (`resolveImportTarget`, `expandsWildcardTo`, `mergeBindings`) that
 * match the LanguageProvider surface from #911.
 *
 * **Non-binding imports rule.** `dynamic-unresolved` passes through with
 * `targetFile: null`; `dynamic-resolved` and `side-effect` resolve to
 * file-level `ImportEdge`s. None of these materialize `BindingRef`s.

   * shortcut, but it is no longer required for correctness.
   *
   * **Multi-hop re-export contract.** `finalize` resolves an edge
   * `A → B (importedName: 'X')` by first looking up `X` in `B.localDefs`.
   * If `B` only has `export { X } from './C'` and does NOT surface `X` in

   * including transitively through cyclic SCCs. The lookup is O(1) and

   *
   * Surfacing re-exported names in `localDefs` is still a valid (and

/**
 * Build per-file re-export closures.
 *
 * **Algorithm.** Iterative SCC-condensed reverse-topological propagation,
 * structurally identical to how `finalize` itself processes the file-
 * level import graph. Replaces the legacy recursive
 * `followReexportChain` crawl with a bounded, stack-safe pass:
 *
 *   1. **Sub-graph.** Build a directed graph whose edges are `wildcard`
 *      drafts, `reexport` drafts, and `named`/`alias` drafts flagged
 *      `reexportsName` by their provider. `namespace`/`reexport-namespace`
 *      are terminal — their target def lives in `localDefs` — and are
 *      excluded on `base.kind`, after any `isNamespaceImport`
 *      reclassification.
 *
 *      The flagged-named case is what languages with no dedicated
 *      re-export form need (today: Python, whose module-level
 *      `from m import x` both binds and republishes). For those providers
 *      the sub-graph is close to the file-level named-import graph, NOT a
 *      sparse barrel graph — measured ~20× more edges on the CPython
 *      stdlib — so read every bound below with that input class in mind.
 *   2. **SCC condensation.** Run the same iterative `tarjanSccs` over
 *      the sub-graph. Output is in reverse-topological order (leaves
 *      first), so when we process an SCC every out-of-SCC neighbor
 *      already has its closure populated.
 *   3. **Per-SCC propagation.**
 *        * Acyclic singleton: one pass — read neighbors' (already
 *          fully populated) closures.
 *        * Cyclic SCC (cycle ≥ 2 files, or self-loop): bounded
 *          fixpoint inside the SCC, capped at `|SCC| + 1` iterations
 *          (each iteration propagates names one hop further around
 *          the cycle; first-wins precedence keeps the map monotone
 *          so the fixpoint converges in at most |SCC| hops).
 *
 * **Precedence semantics.**
 *   * Named re-exports take precedence over wildcards.
 *   * Within each kind, declaration order wins (first match for a
 *     given exported name is kept; later drafts skip). This is only sound
 *     where the language makes a duplicate export illegal — true for TS
 *     and Rust `kind: 'reexport'`, false for the flagged-named form, where
 *     the module namespace rebinds (last write wins) and `if`/`try` pairs
 *     execute exactly one branch. For those, an in-file collision on the
 *     same published name with two different in-workspace targets is
 *     genuinely ambiguous and is dropped instead of guessed — see
 *     `collectAmbiguousReexports`.
 *
 * **Complexity.**
 *   * Pre-pass: O(V + E_re) for SCC, plus O(|SCC| × Σ drafts) per cyclic
 *     SCC. Tree-shaped barrel graphs collapse to O(E_re) total; the
 *     flagged-named input class does not — the CPython stdlib produces 10
 *     cyclic SCCs here where TypeScript-shaped input produced none.
 *   * Per-edge lookup at finalize time: O(1). Target `localDefs` are
 *     indexed by simple name on first use (`findExportByName`), so the
 *     per-hop cost is O(1) rather than a linear scan of the target file.
 *   * `transitiveVia` preserves the exact file path chain for diagnostics
 *     and graph provenance. Building those arrays copies the inherited path,
 *     which is Θ(depth²) in a single-name chain, and Θ(|SCC|²) for a cyclic
 *     SCC whose chain tracks the cycle. `MAX_REEXPORT_DEPTH = 100` bounded
 *     this until it was removed in `fc919ad6` for shallow TypeScript
 *     barrels; **nothing bounds it now**, and the flagged-named class feeds
 *     it far deeper input. Real `__init__.py` chains measure ≤ ~6, so this
 *     is a known unenforced assumption, not a live regression.
 *   * Pathological deep chains that previously needed
 *     `MAX_REEXPORT_DEPTH=100` to bound stack growth now resolve
 *     in full and are bounded only by available memory — the
 *     iterative formulation has no call-stack ceiling.

 * SyntaxError-class ambiguity). First-wins here published the `a` binding as
 * `import-resolved` at full confidence — a definite target for a call that has
 * none, which is the incorrect-context-over-missing-context failure in its
 * purest form. The name is refused instead and reported.
 *
 * Decidable in this pre-pass because it reads only the targets' own
 * `localDefs` — nothing that fills in during the closure fixpoint. Collisions
 * that arrive TRANSITIVELY (two wildcards whose targets each re-export the
 * name from somewhere else) are still first-wins; detecting them needs a set
 * that grows mid-fixpoint, the thing this pre-pass exists to avoid.
 *
 * A name the file DECLARES itself, or re-exports by NAME, is excluded: an
 * explicit export shadows every `export *`, so those collisions are legal and
 * resolved by precedence, not ambiguous.
 *
 * Only MODULE-LEVEL, EXPORT-SHAPED declarations can collide. `localDefs` also
 * carries class members, properties and parameters (a `Property:value` on two
 * unrelated classes, an interface field named `move`), which no `export *`
 * publishes. Counting those produced thousands of phantom collisions on a real
 * monorepo (2,640 on grafana) and — the dangerous half — would have refused a
 * genuinely exported `move()` because some class elsewhere had a `move`
 * property. The wildcard closure loop tolerates the wider set because nobody
 * imports a property by name; a refusal cannot afford the same tolerance.
 *
 * Export evidence, when the language supplies it (`SymbolDefinition.isExported`,
 * tri-state), settles the rest: a def marked `false` is module-private and is
 * neither a provider here nor published by the closure
 * (`indexTopLevelExportsByName`), so a private `function foo` beside an exported
 * one no longer refuses the export — and, the half that matters more, cannot be
 * the first-listed winner the closure binds either. A def marked `true` counts
 * whatever its label, `Variable` included: the closure publishes a `Variable`,
 * so two sources each exporting `const alpha` are a real collision and must be
 * refused rather than first-wins.
 *
 * Without evidence (`isExported` undefined — most languages) `Variable` is
 * excluded from the COLLISION set only: the typical top-level `const` in a
 * barrel's sources is module-private (`const category = ['Axis']` in fourteen
 * option-builder files), so counting it would refuse a real exported constant
 * of the same name for nothing. Residual risk, accepted, for that evidence-free
 * case: a non-exported `function`/`class` sharing its name with an exported one
 * behind the same barrel is counted as a collision and the export is refused —
 * a missing edge, never a wrong one. `ownerId` is only set for class members, so
 * a callable nested in an object literal (`showIf: (cfg) => …` across fourteen
 * option-builder files) still counts as a provider when unmarked. Measured
 * before the export marker existed: grafana@871af0720 refuses 52 names (from
 * 2,640 before the member exclusion), discourse@3f71fa15c 5.
