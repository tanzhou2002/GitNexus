 * `ReferenceSite` — a pre-resolution usage fact collected by `ScopeExtractor`
 * (RFC §3.2 Phase 1; Ring 2 PKG #919).
 *
 * One record per `@reference.*` capture. The extractor records:
 *   - the name being referenced (method/field/class name),
 *   - the source range,
 *   - the innermost lexical scope containing the reference,
 *   - the reference kind (call, read, write, inherits, etc.),
 *   - optional call-form classification from `provider.classifyCallForm`,
 *   - optional explicit-receiver hint for dotted calls (`user.save()`),
 *   - optional arity for call sites.
 *
 * Reference sites are consumed by the resolution phase (RFC §3.2 Phase 4)
 * which routes each through `Registry.lookup` / `resolveTypeRef` and
 * emits the final `Reference` record into `ReferenceIndex`.
 *
 * **Pre-resolution only.** `ReferenceSite` intentionally carries no
 * `toDef`, `confidence`, or `evidence`. Those are populated by the
 * resolution step that reads this record and produces a `Reference`
 * (defined in `./types.ts`).
