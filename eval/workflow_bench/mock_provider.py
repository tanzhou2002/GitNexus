"""A scriptable stand-in for Anthropic and OpenAI, for running the harness offline.

Every defect this benchmark shipped in the last round was invisible to its own
tests for the same reason: the tests exercised a layer BELOW where the code
runs. The usage log was never written because the proxy is a subprocess with a
constructed environment. The callback could not be imported because LiteLLM
loads it by path. Failures went unrecorded because only the async hook was
overridden. Each was caught by CI or review, never by a unit test, because the
unit test called the function directly instead of driving the path that calls
it.

This closes that gap without spending money. It speaks the two wire protocols
the harness actually depends on, so a run can go through the real sandbox, the
real Claude Code CLI, the real gateway and the real usage callback, and only
the model is fake:

    POST /v1/messages   Anthropic Messages, streaming and non-streaming
    POST /v1/responses  OpenAI Responses, which the gateway translates into

Point the runner at it with ``--base-url http://127.0.0.1:<port>``, which is
the same supported path the free-model proxy documentation already uses, or
give it to LiteLLM as ``api_base`` to exercise the gateway.

Scripted, not simulated: replies are supplied by the caller, so a test decides
what the model "says", which tools it asks for, and exactly what usage it
reports. That last part is what makes provider-native accounting testable at
all - real cache hits are not reproducible on demand, but a declared
``cache_read`` of 44_000 is.
