"""Append each upstream request's usage exactly as the provider reported it.

This runs INSIDE the LiteLLM proxy, on the far side of the translation that
turns an OpenAI response into the Anthropic shape Claude Code expects. That is
the only point that still knows which provider served the request, what model
actually answered, and what the native usage object said before its fields were
renamed into someone else's semantics.

Deliberately self-contained: the proxy loads this file by path from the config
directory, so it cannot assume ``workflow_bench`` is importable. Normalization
lives in workflow_bench.provider_usage and runs offline over what this writes -
the native object is the evidence, and deriving from it here would mean the
derivation could not be revisited without re-running a paid sweep.

Never raises. A cell that fails still spent money upstream, and losing the
accounting because the log write failed would be the worse outcome.
