"""Per-request usage as the provider reported it, plus a derived cross-provider view.

The benchmark has been reading token counts out of Claude Code's session output,
which is Anthropic-shaped whatever actually served the request. That works until
the upstream is OpenAI, because the two providers do not merely name their fields
differently - they mean opposite things by them:

    Anthropic:  total_input = input_tokens
                            + cache_creation_input_tokens
                            + cache_read_input_tokens
                (input_tokens is only the UNCACHED remainder; cache fields ADD)

    OpenAI:     total_input = input_tokens
                ordinary    = input_tokens - cached_tokens - cache_write_tokens
                (input_tokens is the WHOLE; cache fields are SUBSETS)

Adding OpenAI's three together double-counts; subtracting Anthropic's
under-counts. So the native object is authoritative and is stored verbatim, and
the normalized view is derived from it per provider.

The second rule is that a field nobody reported is UNKNOWN, not zero. A stored
``cache_read = 0`` previously could mean either "the provider said zero" or "our
adapter never looked", and those two must never be written identically again:
the first says caching is not working, the second says we cannot tell.
