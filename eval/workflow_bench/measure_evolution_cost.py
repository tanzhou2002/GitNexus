"""Cheap cost model for the skill-evolution review generation.

This is the ce-optimize measurement harness. It does not start Claude and it
does not replay a run. It reads the review corpus, the evolve defaults and the
workflow's workers default, then schedules the measured cell durations in
``session_durations.json`` the way ``sweep_task_cells`` schedules real cells.

Everything priced here is measured. Cell durations and the proposer session
come from a real artifact, and the work outside the agent sessions comes from
that run's own step wall minus the time its sessions and proposer account for.

Weekly assumes a matching seed, so every reusable comparator cell is skipped
and only the candidate arm is paid. Cold assumes an empty seed.
