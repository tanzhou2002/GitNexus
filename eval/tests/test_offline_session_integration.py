"""A session end to end with only the model faked.

The layers between the CLI and the row are where this harness has actually
shipped bugs - the artifact that could not be written, the usage that was never
recorded, the evidence that was scored from the wrong directory. Every one of
them sat below the level its tests exercised. These run the real session path
against a scripted provider, so the only thing not real is what the model says.
