"""A whole sweep, offline: real runner, real sessions, scripted model.

The layers between a model turn and a promotion decision had never been
exercised together. Unit tests covered each in isolation and the paid runs that
would have covered the composition kept dying, so the contracts BETWEEN them
went unverified - and that is where this harness has repeatedly shipped bugs.

This drives runner.main() the way the workflow does. Everything is real: task
selection, hidden-oracle capture, the sandbox, the CLI subprocess, artifact
capture, review scoring against the oracle, aggregation, the health guard, and
the promotion gate. Only the model is scripted, through MockProvider.

Two provisioning steps are stubbed because this environment cannot supply them,
and neither is harness logic: the pinned gitnexus runtime mounts (no
node_modules in a worktree) and the sanitized graph build (needs the gitnexus
CLI at a mounted path). Containment is host-unsafe here; bubblewrap stays with
the real-sandbox canary in the containment job.
