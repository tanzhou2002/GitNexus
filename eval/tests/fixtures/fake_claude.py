"""A stand-in for the Claude Code CLI: real HTTP, real tool execution, real stream-json.

Not a mock of the harness's own code. It does what the CLI does at the two
boundaries the harness depends on - it calls ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL for a turn, it
EXECUTES the tool blocks that come back, and it prints the stream-json event
sequence the parent parses. Only Write really executes - it is what produces the
review artifact, so the artifact path has to be genuine end to end. Skill is
MODELLED: it validates the request and returns a synthetic result, because the
parent's evidence gate keys on the request/result pair rather than on a skill
having loaded, and a fixture cannot load a real one. Bash is stubbed outright:
arbitrary shell from a scripted reply buys no fidelity for the paths this
exercises and plenty of ways to damage the host. Everything between
those boundaries (the sandbox,
the artifact capture, the scoring, the row) stays real, which is the whole
point: those are the layers that shipped bugs no unit test could see.

Reads the prompt from stdin, as the real CLI does under "-p --input-format text".
